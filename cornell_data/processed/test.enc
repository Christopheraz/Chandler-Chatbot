Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
She's not a...
Have fun tonight?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Like you care.
That's not
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
But she doesn't want to date.
And where're you going?
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
Assail your ears for one night.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What?
Do what?
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William didn't even go to high school
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Who?
Wholesome.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
My grandmother's .
Was that your sister?
Hi.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
I don't want you to wait for me.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
I'm not bargaining!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Chief knows.
Chief says -- he has a God.
What did they say about Granada before today?
We don't need to know.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Where can I meet this man?
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
You tell that to them!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
No, he is here.  Shit...
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Are you married?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
Do you have coffee?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Who did cause and origin?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah, right.
Takin' a bath.
Only one guys checked in?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Describe him.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
You're Polish?
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
What's your accomplishment.
That's good.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
How old are your kids?
Any chance we can do that again?
I am butcher.
And what do you do with the bones?
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where is escort service?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
Two weeks.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Get in the bathroom!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
You got that?
Viewer discretion advised!
A cheap hotel.
That's what it looks like to me.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
How did you start the fire this time?
Your doctor?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
It's possible.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
The antenna has to be replaced.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.

I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I see.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
How about chargin' the battery?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Hey, what about me?
You lying son of a bitch...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Yeah?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
Let's go.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You stay with me...
Where's luther?
We missed.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
It's late, they're closing...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Billy Bear...
So do you...been a long day.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
I guess he got the message...
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Thanks for the coffee.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Jack, wait...
Hiya, kid.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Tell me.
Stall.
How hot are they?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
Five bills.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
She's an exception..
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Of course.
Where's Leeloo?
At least, the cat comes back.
Uh... at least fifty.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Priest...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
The Fifth Element...
6... 5...
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Just one... why me?
I'm so tired...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Exactly.
This is all that survived?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Your clothing reeks of it.
I'm not accusing you...
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
What happened to you?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
And they are?
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Why?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Look, you cocksucker...
That's right.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
You're asking me why?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Truman Capote.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Nothing remotely like this.
You're joking.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
How will I get it to you?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
No.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
Yes.
Why do you think he did it?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Alice, you think you can leave?
What's wrong?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Then what else can we do?
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
I'll tell you later.
What do you mean?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Yeah...I guess.
You're right.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
I've got to go.
But Dad --
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
You do good work, Alice.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Who's Jacob?
Who?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
So?
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
I think you're right.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Well?
What about down?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Now they feel it...down below.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
What do you think?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Swell!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
See what?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
If you get it?
Really.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Where'd you get the blood?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What?
Why do they do that?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
It's pretty old.
How about a Big Mac?
I know.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Huh?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
So?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
You and Mel Gordon?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
No problem. Look, I...
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Forget it.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
You're not using it today?
It makes me sad.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Take care, Wade.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
There was something. It happened up your way.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
No thanks. I don't drink.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Uh, we got a problem here.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Can we do that?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Yes, Mr. President.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
How many others killed?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Tower, here.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Do you have to be so brutal?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
I don't know why you stayed.
What's going on?
who can I say is calling?
You wanna knock of f?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
That just doesn't make any sense.
Did you feel that?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Not now, Elaine!
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Roger.
All right.  Here.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Both pilots!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Surely there must be something you can do.
Captain, how soon can we land?
That's right.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
And a little ice.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
You okay?
You are Cassandra?
In there.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Uh, Matthew...
But I-- .
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
We all did.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Ss'kya'ta'.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
How long until it blows?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Now, wait a second --
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Yes, Hicks?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
The corner!  Ready?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Range twenty meters.
And how are we today?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
Where is she?
Maestro.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
No.
Where?
Hardly.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Do you think that's funny?
No!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Yes!
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
No. Don't answer it!
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Really?
I see.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
Alone.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What?
Why you?
When, may I ask?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Who was your teacher?
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Twenty-six.
I have no idea.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Am I not welcome?
That's not what I hear.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Papa!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Where does he work?
Why? What has happened?
Yes?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Leave that alone!
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Love, Sire!
How could I not?
I'm afraid not.
I can't say. Really
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
A Mass for the dead.
What happened? Is it over?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
Do you mean that?
No! No, it's him!
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Confutatis Maledictis.
The Fire.
Yes.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Also identical?
What for?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
What do you want?
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
You cannot say that!
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
My son, no one can speak for God.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
You mean that play?
Exactly.
I've seen the manuscript.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Here I am, my angel.
Who is she?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Surely you're not suggesting...
Yes, Doctor.
It was a wolf.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Twenty-eight.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Will you come with me?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Not just a patient -- me.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I was dreaming again?
There is only one bed.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
No.
Why on earth do you say that?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
All right, you two, move along.
Where am I?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
I don't know.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Hello.
Did you hear that?
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Come on, where?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
It's in front of us.
Where are we going?
You really scared me, you shithead.
David!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Thank you.
I could hang myself.
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Yeah.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Yes, sir.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Well, you can. You always could.
What is?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
My apartment.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
John, how's your wife this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Yes.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
I don't know.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why - well, I
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Helen!
Oh, make that uniform blue.
It's all right. Thanks.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
I'm afraid so.
Oh, Matt . . .
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
What time did Matt Brown get in?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
Corn gonna shoot at me?
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
You have no shame.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Beg pardon?
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Ride with me, cousin?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Not now.
The James-Younger Gang.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Missed you, cousin.
I think one of 'em's glass.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
The safe. Now.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
What is it?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
You can shut up now.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
A fair number, Ma.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Stop it. This is just sad.
What?
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Really?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Sir?
How did you know?
I want them arrested and hanged!
What is that?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
It's a plain end, see? So?
What are you doing tonight?
I haven't seen you around here.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Is your Evian spiked?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's good-looking.
You're inhuman.
Are you sure?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
It's just not.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
When?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Jean? Sorbet?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
A model? An actor?
Well.
Don't tell him you're here.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Who do you ask?
But...has anyone seen him in London?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Don.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Let's see...  That you were with-
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I've questioned him.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
I know, I know.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
It's gonna get cold.
He wasn't acting?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
You're living here?
Okay.
What?!
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
What're you implying.
I heard what happened.
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
...Worse?
Okay, #2.
Longitude 109 --
You calling Phil and Randy?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Cool!
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Please don't go.
Bring it to the other location.
...You got my E-mail?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
What is it?
Where is he?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
She's working on another lead right now.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Yes Basil?
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
My wedding tackle.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
I love you, Austin.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
That's not mine.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Commander, I have to log it...
We've got a lot of work to do.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Ow! You shot me!
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Dr. Evil?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
An evil petting zoo?
I don't want to.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
... death ...
... love ...
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
The result would be ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
1922. Why the kippers?
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
What is it?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
But --
What kept you?
Have you any place in mind?
Where's Mother?
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Privately owned by ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
That's not playing by the rules.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you mean?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You're kidding.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Not interested.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Yes I did.
I've tried to change her mind.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I can't trust you!
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
That's it, prick lips.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
What can I be doing for you?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
You've been having strange sex...!
Where'd she go?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
-- He killed people --
I like what you've done with the place.
Sheep don't count.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
...Not now, Brian.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
What are we going to do about this?
You're back.
I work for city hall.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Thanks for the invite.
Homey.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I'm sorry.
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
Just wondering.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
I have a job.
Management were pin heads.
Coffee sucked.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
I'm busy.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Where's Sean?
He treats you okay?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
-- Burn them.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
I'm a little busy right now --
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
What case?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Yeah!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Yeah, him.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
Seconds and thirds, too.
How much?
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
Why?
How you sound?
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How was it?
Nobody told me anything.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
You okay?
How so?
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
Light?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Can I kiss you too?
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Where is he?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Oh her.
She hates dem.
I heard ya lady is wild.
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...perfect...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
Why don't you answer?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
And so I am.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Good gracious!  What is this?
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Yes, sir.
For whom else have you worked?
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
I have faced that problem before.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
What do we do?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
Do what?
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
He admitted it.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Who killed Pike?
What the hell are you talking about --
That's horseshit and you know it.
I'm sorry, Bill.
Stay where you are.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Move him.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Think it'll work?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Four --
What if I don't want it?
I should probably write that down.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
Fifty minutes.
Who, Levi --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Lucky girl.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
There was one time when I was eleven...
Karl.
You're not trying to run away?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
Let's get out of here.
Daffodils?
Really.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
It's bad.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Do you love your father?
What happened?
We rented a car.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
That really happened?
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
What's this?
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
What?
Right.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Today is bath day.
You don't understand anything.
I don't want to know.
What?
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Fine.
Oh Jesus.
He will come back.
Sometimes which?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I got what I paid for.
Get out
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
What?
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I don't know.
What was her name?
You know you can come under the blanket.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Lazarus?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
Hey.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
You been home yet?
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
I keep the heat on.
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Or what? OR WHAT?
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Let me say somethin' first...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
In my house, you watch that lip...
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
We drinkin' buddies now?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I don't want you to let go.
Why you say that?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Uh-huh.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
Keep the change on that.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
I think she got to you, pappy.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Get rid of it.
Some party.
What are you doing?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
What'd she say?
You cool, Ich?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Give me a break, would you?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Yakuza.
Gaiijin.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
What's that for?
Why's that?
He's on duty.
I need someone to translate for me.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
They want your autograph.
What if I chant?
Can't make you change your mind?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Why me?
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Where?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
And what can he do for you?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
But not to last.
Why are you staring at us?
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
You equipped for random questions?
You start.
Okay, but...
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Sorry.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Too old.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
It's a good job.
Sorry.
Me.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Yeah.
How come you're not on the job?
They could clean around the arrangement.
Where the hell you been?
Yes.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What?
A tortoise.  What's that?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Where are we going?
Oh, that's nice.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Oh, I could die...
Hey, what are you doing?!
Take it. damn it!
Why doesn't it never work out?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Then forget it.
The big one!
Now, get out!!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
That's ridiculous.
Yes, Eve?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
I've got to go, now.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Your mom made that all by herself.
I promise. Is that all?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Yeah?
Why not? He has great pants.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
What?!
Good-bye, Adam.
Thirty-five.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Sorry, Mom!
I'm afraid you've got to.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Then after that it's safe.
No.  I think it's just right.
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Yes...
Yes.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
What's that supposed to mean?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Go to the bathroom.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Give it back to him.
Have him committed.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Then what?
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Tower, say again!!
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Who knows you have these?
Jeffrey nothing.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Do you like talk like that?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Frank? Can you stand up?
Look.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
You like to open me, don't you?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Frank gone?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Hello?
Hey? You like to walk.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Okay Frank.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
That sounds great!
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
No, you're right.
Good to see you, son.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Why not?
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
Yeah?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What was that all about?
Where to?
It's okay.
My father has a gun at home.
No Jeffrey!!
Lord's name.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Yeah, well...
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
They got nothing.
You guys?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
We... met them last night.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Is that right, Rambo?
Now, you will receive us.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Who were the victims?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Promise me boys.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
This is some crazy shit, man!
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
Yes.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
He's a nigger.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Did you see that?
Dignan, calm down.
Can I get that credit card from you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
What about them?
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
That coward. Son of a bitch.
We said 48 hours.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I have an idea for that.
When'd you get back?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Where's Kumar?
What are you doing?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
No. I'm not.
Nice to meet you.
You mean a safecracker?
How does that feel?
No, that door over there.
Exactly. Woah.
Yeah.
Did you ever steal a car before?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Hector woudn't do anything.
Are you serious?
I hope not.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
How do you say nineteen?
What do you mean?
What?
I don't know about that.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
That's your domain.
His name was Swifty?
What happened?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
What do you mean get back?
This could be a trap.
You don't even know his name.
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Dignan.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I didn't think there was an alarm.
What's that?
Here we go.
I might have mentioned it.
How you doing, Bob?
And what does that cover?
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
No. I just have short hair.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Come on in!
The world needs dreamers, son.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
I want to know about Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
...this is Conklin's computer.
May I finish?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
No good options left?
Keep going...
Lots of people...
Who else knows about this?
Then what?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
Front. Use your teeth.
Who sent you to Greece?
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
What if it's not who you think it is?
But you found another choice.
I know it's a dream.
What is this, a game?
My first job.
Okay, how do you want to do it?
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
Here?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Some women like Dobermans --
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
It was in Latin, sir.
So let the council swear publicly.
Does anyone know his politics?
What news of the north?
When will his trial be?
That's just a dream, William!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
A common thief.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
No. He did not.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
So it didn't feel... weird?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Know what?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Look what you made me do!
What the hell are you doing?
Just get out, didja?
I thought I was the bad guy!
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Good.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Yes, I come.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
We said "no questions."
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
You can believe that if you want to.
For the last time, put them on the table.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
When did you first find out he was alive?
No, not yet.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
But Richard, no, I, I --
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Did he give any reason?
-- Yes?
Are you ready Ilsa?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
-- Is what?
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Mademoiselle.
Hello, Louis.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Manages what?
I have my orders.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
What is your nationality?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
You ever going to bed?
Good. Then have a drink.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Uh, my watch stopped.
Just a little something of my own.
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
It's bad.
Nobody remembers that.
Save some for tomorrow.
Get up.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too little you'll die.
Take it, damn it.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
As much as anybody.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
What brings you out to the sticks?
How was Russia?
Chuck.
You can't go now.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
I would never --
What's that, written on the sail?
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
You're Chuck Noland.
Trying.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
But I might not have.
I'm touched.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
That's all there is.
What, then?
Only if you can afford it.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What'd she die of?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
*What* will be okay?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
But did you know him?
What kind of plane are you flying?
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
There was no visible wound?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Nobody's named this one yet.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I don't think so.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
You're not yet three months, are you?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
She took off in the night!
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Let's just slow down for a second...
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
So how'd you get caught?
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Like what?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
When?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Because you killed one of my crew.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Stake you?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Mr. King, I think --
Uh-huh.
Look at you... You want to go.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Jesus... Take it easy.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
Tick-tock...
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
We're working for the King.
Why?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
You going to have the time?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
A Fed? Is he close?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
I got scared.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Ouch.
What's the Blue Book price?
Three years, two months. March '93.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
You want me drunk?
You're my prisoner.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
You're shaking. What is it?
I loved it blond.
Probably.
You're my conscience.
It's the truth.
That girl, she works at the casino --
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
You will?
Never. Why do you ask?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Nothing about you.
I hate public transport.
No.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
So why did you come to my casino?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Toss you for it.
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
You're serious.
And I thought you were only after my body.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
Next time it'll be my neck.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Of course I recognised him!
You did?
You've been avoiding me.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I put them on together.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
We check every four days.
I don't think so.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Girlfriend?
The key!
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
What was that, I didn't hear...
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Hey, bomb...
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Why don't you have more time?
And you can only do it once, right?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No?
I'm on a break.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
That's a lotta crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
Can I say something in my defense?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
I ain't mad at you...
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Damn... Are you alright?
I don't want to move away.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Lemme get my coat.
Too early to tell.
Is the social studies class over for today?
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
That would be appropriate, yes.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Yes on all counts.
The other ones?
You lost me.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
How's this about me?
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Where?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Unlikely.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They're prisoners to their genes.
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
She tells you how I've been--
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
True, but--
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
Gin.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Sorry.
Beth? I can't believe it.
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
...at twenty-thirty hours.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Sunday, but...
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Uh... dudes?
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
I found the Volvo.
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Jam, listen up.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
They're not idiots.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
GOOD MORNING!
Yeah.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
We went to a hotel.
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
They suspended me for two days.
Who?
Will you please talk to me?
My mom is gone.
Is that a cellar door?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
I think he saved my life.
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
What about your family, Donnie?
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
If God exists?
What is going to happen?
Thank you.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
I... What can we do?
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
Beg pardon?
Where is she?!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Really, Loretta?
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Thank God for bunge cords.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
What're you doin' here?
What?
I just did.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Yes...
Shut it up, Loretta.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Dakota.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Becky was my only shot at state!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
The king can do no wrong! 
Send for my car...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Well - what is he now?
No, but I shot some ducks.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
I can't do it...
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Are you getting tired?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Bah!! 
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
I don't remember.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Did it go well, darling?
Yes.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
I found it.
Like this. 
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Yes sir.
Good! How is the patient?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
I don't understand.
Yes, I think I can.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
What is it, Treves?
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
How awful for John.
You're English.
Yyyess.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Your mother?
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Fine.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
What are what?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
But you LOVED her all the same...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
I'll bring it back.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
No... we don't...
No. 
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Have you done this sort of thing before?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Let's hack her to pieces.
We're missing all the fun...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
I met this girl...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
You must help us.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Well, what else do we do?
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
Shut up!
I must KILL! Kill!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
And something to sharpen them with?
How are you today?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
I'm so excited. Yay!
I'm sorry.
Really? Because --
I don't have one.
I don't really know how --
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
I'm not nuts.
Probably see you at the book store.
What?
You pick it.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Egad, were you horrified?
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
Hi there.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Yeah, like that.
Um, no.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I'm nervous, too.
Doesn't sound like me.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
It's true.
Hi, it's Joel.
Naomi.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Yeah.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Well, what should we do?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
What's this?
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Order me a pastrami for after?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Siwash, huh?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetkame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Extraordinary!
How does she like what in bed?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
I'm cold.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
The containment, Second Containment...
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
What?
What is it?
90 over 50 and falling... .
Does he know that?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
What, Justin, what shows you?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Alive?
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I don't know...
Don't... don't do this...
I'm not the Devil.
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Captain Miller...
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
Skipper...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Everybody okay?
What's causing the readings?
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
We have to do something, oh God...
Hey...
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Relax, it's casual.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What the --!
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
No more cracks about how I look.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Leonard, how's the feed?
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Feeling better?
For science.
What? What do you mean you --
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
What are you doing?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
I understand the business reasons.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Oh, I think you already have.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
Why can't you do it?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
See you later.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Leave me alone!
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I don't know.
What's wrong?
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
It's definitely your mama.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Yeah?
Yo.
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
How've you been?
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What do you think?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Can I come in?
Yes.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
I don't know. I guess so.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
If you graduate.
You look like you could still be in high school.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
That's a nice shirt.
Are you really nineteen?
What about those other guys you live with?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Do you want to come inside?
I don't know.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
John Bonham?
Really?
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
A major!
Really?
Las Vegas.
Hell, no!
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Damn right!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
You degenerate pig!
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Read the newspapers.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
IS IT CLEAR?!
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Oh!
And that's how I ended up here.
They're right here.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
You all sure about this?
Where's the tunnel?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
My husband...
He only shot you once.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Covered.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
What?!
COME ON!
Are you lying to me?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
In my eyes, officer.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
No.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
...So what do you think?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Bread?
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
What?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
...So you think I should go.
Frances...
What?
Oh no...
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
You know something, Harry?
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
Yeah. I don't know.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Pretty morning.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Say you promise.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Don't... talk crazy.
Haven't you heard what I said?
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
Where are you going?
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
You're kidding.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
You're an outcast.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Kill you? Hardly that.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Must've been a terrible row.
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Our decision. Together.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
So do I.
Brother and sister no more.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Professor?
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
I resent God's monopoly.
How much longer?
Yes? And?
No. They don't.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
Who are you?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
We should go now.
Melvin Belli.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
What'll you do when you leave here?
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
I'll be along.
What the hell?
Holy shit...
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
How many with you?
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
He's my son.
Who's this?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Pass.
Why are you so agitated?
He backed down.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
What did you call me?
You too, preacher?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
I promise.
I'm going for 'em!
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What's in Mexico?
Creepy guy.
Do you believe me?
Yeah.
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
He says you were scratching.
I wasn't scratching!
Richie? You okay?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
She's in the other room.
This ain't the time.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Yeah, it's mine.
You could take their head off.
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Really, I have no problem with --
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Across the board, sir.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
White House boys want a private meeting.
"The Lark Report."
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
California.
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I'm sure it is.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Just do it, okay?
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Chances of recovery?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
So why are you telling me this?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
I'd sure like to know who.
They're more afraid of you.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
He was married?
At first.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I think you look beautiful.
Sure, sure.
Just askin'
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
I take it this file is still open.
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Who the hell are all these people?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
He's not going to do it.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
What the hell are you doing?
Five bucks.
This is not the place...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Well, I think you're cute.
Hence the radiation.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
Have them sealed off.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Do I know you?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
What's with the chewing gum?
What'd they say?
Hello?
Well good, that's very... nice.
"The show must go on."
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Shut up.
And note the sucked in gut.
It's okay. Listen-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Where are the miners?
...Okay
Your last name.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
JASON...
You should have let me hit him.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
I heard it too.
Closer?  I can try.
Commander...
"Deception..." "Lies."
But...Why?
Could be this.
Do your best, Tommy...
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Find them.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Is that a fact.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
While they're strung out?
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Wil...
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
Are you going to keep him, sir?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
Partially...
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
They help me understand why we fight.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
What is it, Marquis?
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Martha... what?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
But not more than your comfort.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
All people have rights!
Yes!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
I reserved a Cadillac.
You're kidding me, right?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
You get the money?
I have to ask you for that key.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Who the fuck are you?
I don't like waiting.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
You just did.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
You mean, Leo?
What does that mean?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
What's it called?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
It was in the Herald.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Who told you that?
How? By taking my money?
It's not one of these?
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
What're you doing here?
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
"Cotton".
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
I think it's not horrible.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Harry... My God...
You don't act like it?
I'll be right back.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
He already knew it.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Pick 'n' Save.
Hello, Doris.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry -
Sixty pounds.
Where from?
Roger.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Guess I'll just keep working.
Did you?
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
What is it?
How long to fix?
How long, then?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
I think you know.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
You smashed it!
What the fuck -- ?
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
What's slow?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
You okay?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Murphy to Epps.
You just shoot at something?
He needs a doctor.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Collision? With what?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
That much I think we've already established.
Over the gold.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
What now?
Ho-ly shit.
You've been out for about a day.
What about the gold?
What's this?
How should I know?
Yup.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Forget it.
Do you want something to drink?
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Yeah, well --
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Okay... I promise.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Since when is she an "actress"?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Or maybe not.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Hey - why do you have this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Which loser?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
Are you sure?
Oh yeah...
"Funky"?
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
I'll bet he never jerks off...
What was that all about?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
It's a surprise.
Where did you get that?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
No, really...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
How repulsive!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
I said "great"...
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
You still interested in that?
Do you have any old Indian records?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Good luck...
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
Every guy has a type!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well when can we do something?
And you like them?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
What about Joe?
No... forget it...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why? What did she tell you?
Did she say that?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Yes?
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
Morning, friend, glorious day.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
Starting now, we attack them.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Yes he is.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Finish your tour?
...one shot...
John, it will not be easy.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I'll do it.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I'm not even good for me.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Is this the spot?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Who are you going to call?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
I know.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I await the word of Vigo.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
What now, Brainiac?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Is that your professional opinion?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
That's it.  Get out.
I'll scream.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
That is one speedy mutt.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Did you see it?  What was it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
What is it?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
No, you may not.
Circle?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
Oh!  You're here.
Something was definitely here.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
All right.  I'll try.
Life is just a state of mind.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Who was the architect?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Judgement Day ...
Stantz?  You okay in there?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
Those are priceless sculptures.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Then you'd be out of a job.
Where is my family?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Yes, Caesar.
God of passages and changes?
You're hearing about somebody else.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
Would that Marcus had lived.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
What the hell was all that about?
You brought the army into Rome.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
You need to come home!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
You teach them!
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
How much money is involved?
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Hello.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Yes.
Okay.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Here? In Berkeley?
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
You won't?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't see how we can.
Tomorrow?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben!
Ben.
What's that?
What are you then?
What?
Who screamed?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What?
What?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
So?
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Hello, Benjamin.
May I have a drink?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Yes.
I got a single room.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Wood or wire? They have both.
You what?
Yes I do.
How do you get out of the house?
Right.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Why did you do that?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
Are you shocked?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
What?
Not particularly.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
That's enough.
I was just kidding around.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
What are you doing?
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Thank you.
Go home now.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I do.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
I'm just --
I guess -- about my future.
No.
You got me.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I'd like to hear it.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Have you a minute now?
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Need any help?
No.
Why?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
You can't.
Like dancing?
You're a fool!
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Of course.
Chasing what?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Why do you hide in my room?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Go away. Who are you --?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Then you know him?
The Baron is tired?
What?
We could come to my room.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
The war.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
And the child isn't coming?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
A man might what?
You dance splendidly.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Am I!
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Movies?
You...
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Well?
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Yes --
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Hurry, Suzette.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
It is time for the performance.
I could not think of not accepting.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Have I kept you waiting?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
What you need is some relaxation.
Hi, Bobo.
Bobo, no, I --
Your what?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
What? He's going to be all right!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
It's not your fault.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Roy Dillon.
Perk, remember?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Bluebell came in?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
A future. The only future I've got.
Scram. Go home.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Get well soon.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Big spender.
Working the what?
I've heard the name.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Atascadero.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Don't I get any say in this?
No! Because I --
Bullshit!
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Roy Dillon?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
You up to it now?
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Oh, Jesus.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Well, when you put it that way.
Where?
Only the real stiffs.
Detective...
A dead body?
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
It's an option.
Where are you going?
I'm not leaving without her.
What?  Where is she?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I'm okay.
It's always John.
Who?
Michael Meyers.
Can't you hold it?
Shane's going as a condom.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You're so easy...
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
But I've seen him!
See what I'm talkin' about?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Who are you?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
But surely Rogers isn't --
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
It's a bitch.
I suppose.
Home.
I didn't tell you everything.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Everybody thinks that.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
How are you, honeybunch?
You've come to the right man.
I forget mine for years on end.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Blue soup.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Ask it!
Man and boy.
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
England?
Oh hell.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
I'm a man.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Dad--
I'm talking to you gently now.
What time do you get off work, my child?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
It's so--so stark.
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
No.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
I don't think so.
If he wants to go.
Things.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
You're begging him to kill you?
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
What a handsome word.
No.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
It's always locked.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And her fianc!
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
It died for your sins.
Hands and knees, you say?
I love you!  Have a cigar!
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Was I ever of use?
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Leave the rifle here.
What will you do, Colonel?
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
Don't worry about it.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
That goes double for me.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Stay home tonight!
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
We don't have a maid any more.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
I see.
Did you see him?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
What?
The what?
You know each other?
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Do it!
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
No, just not the type.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
You want a tip?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I'm getting angry.
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Yeah.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
You don't drink?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
She's dead.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Neither am I.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Why do you say that?
She left you right?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
Who's paying you?
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
What's it called?
But the police...
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Does she know anything about this?
What is it, Jake?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Okay.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Where's Ratan?
I don't know what you're talking about.
But I...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
What exactly do you have in mind?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
To his own daughter?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Your tree.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
Because if you are...
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
A block of ice.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, no.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Nice to meet you.
It's very interesting.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
That's a nice teapot.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Well, I don't...
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Of course.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Just like this.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Maude.
Oh, Harold. 
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Why?
No.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
No.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Thank you, Uncle.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
That's right.
The moment of truth.
Oh sure.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Yes... Yes. You look...
She's done it.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
WHY?
Then why are you here?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
See what??
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
The freak in the gas mask --
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Helping you -- I just --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
I like that...
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Cocky.
He -- loves you.
I know.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Hello, I'm --
What's the problem?
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
I have to speak to my father.
I don't remember.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Hell...
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Who did?
So you were cheated.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Kirsty? It's very late.
Well?
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Sure.
I don't know where to begin...
That depends.
What's wrong?
I'll get the doctor.
I got through.
I found a room.
You like?
Is Julia here?
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
I have to talk to you.
No you don't.
Get the fuck out of here.
You know I do know the way home.
It's late.
I beg your pardon?
Do I know you?
Really.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Well what about the new Echo --
He's got one!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Anna.
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Rob.
Good weekend?
Rob --!
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
I dunno.
Shit!
Hi.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
I guess.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
You know the difference.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Wanna go to dinner?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I mean it.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Enough, Liz.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Which way are you going?
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
How old is Richard?
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
He'd want to know about all this.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
This is against the rules.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
You're wrong.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
Yes.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
I see.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
He knows about you.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Don't.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
No!
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Never take up poker, Detective.
-Auditorium nostrum-
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
You're not from these parts.
Aye.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
He told me there could be only one.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
It is the truth.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Aye.
And you?
Of course.
But I did live.
Far away.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
My father taught me.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Spare a chair?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
He found us even there.
I knew his great-grandfather.
We have some unfinished business.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
You're a kind man to be sure.
The resemblance is amazing.
Same.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
No. Roy. Roy V.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
Yes!
Where are we going?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
How long would the interview take?
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Hildy!
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
Done what?
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Sure you can. Come on.
I know, Walter, but I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
He's in the insurance business.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Hildy!
Where's Bruce?
Double-crossing swine!
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Look at me, Hildy --
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Will you come here?
Don't tell me you were worried!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Who do you want?
What?
Let's see the money.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, that about covers everything.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
What a chase!
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
Shoot to kill, I said.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Okay.  Forget it. 
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Mother!
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Quiet, Mollie!
What's the idea?
Get the Governor on the phone!
Why not?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Pinkus.
A very fine-looking women.
There she is!
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Can I try?
No, she didn't.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
It's easy. I've done it.
They've got the real thing outside.
But Dad, It's the News.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
I don't know?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
And absent bridegrooms!
Oh, that.
And what's that?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
I agree.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
He left!
Thank you.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
Can I help you with something?
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
The Duke?
She's pretty cute.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Thanks.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
And...
That kid is one horny retard.
Goddamn.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
That's nice.
How long is that gonna take?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I still don't.
Recover any bodies?
What'd ya got there?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
This is way too fucked up for words.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Thank you.
We gotta break it open.
Yes, sir.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Is everything fine?
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
My little French.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Be still my crotch.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
You've got to respect that.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
My God! The fork! The fork!
What are you doing in there?
I'm sorry about my parents.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Shaving cream?
Did you see that?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Ooka.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
Puff, put the gun down.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You know what's good for him?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
You being cute?
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Now, when did you adopt me?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
What's the matter? What happened?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How do we stand?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Who's he?
Why?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
You don't need a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Is this all we got left?
HOW MUCH?!
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
When?
That's right. When?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Call it.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm not.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
You told me.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Thanks.
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
You going out?
What's this supposed to mean?
Well, he owns things.
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Leave now.
Why should I?
He went off someplace.
Well, what's the matter?
Now and then. You know how it is.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
California. Oakland.
Very good shot.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
You want me to stay?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
So, what do you do?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
What's wrong, Ellen?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Do you know how to follow a map?
But it's not, Jimmy.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What do you want me to do?
You still believe in him.
Love was never our problem.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
What're you talking about?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Not really...
Pops!
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
What the hell is that?
Not listed, huh?
Perfect, she's using it.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
What the hell are you doing?
Nice meeting you.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
With their shields down it might be possible.
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
I didn't even see them fire!
Stevie... I can't...
I'm not leaving.
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
How's the head?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
I'm through!
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
This one. I think he's in here.
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Well, what was left of him.
How did you she was a Nazi?
What?
This is intolerable!
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
It's a new experience for me.
Who are you?
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
Miss Scott panicked?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Who?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
No, the stones are mine!
I like the service here.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
You all right?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
What about the future?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
And they don't even know what it really is.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
My name is AL.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Al.
Where are we?
Who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
Loading a gun.
Yep.
Hear voices don't I.
You're gonna explain.
You'll be alive.
No they won't.
Why not?
JOE Or what?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
You are CRAZY!
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
...and a license to kill...
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Touch her.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
Joe, be careful!
You're doing great with her.
And on my time.
You been had. We have.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
What next!
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
And Dieter?
Holy...
I have been... I think you're right.
Awwww...
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
Bit expensive, sir.
That crazy guy?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
We're here.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Who?
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Blake?
Blake said that?
What's so funny?
You again.
Promise you what?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
We're very close.
And you?
Where we going?
Get us one.
What?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
I know the territory.
This going to work?
What happened?
Why did you, then?
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Riuji?
He wants to apologise.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
Excuse me?
This the only spare?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
Three hours.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
Shit...
I don't know what he was thinking.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
I'm not touching my film...
That computer has everything...
Hey, Lowell.
You're sure you want to do this?
Is there any more rice...?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Where should I wash them?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Thank you, Bob.
No classes this morning?
What's wrong?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Hardly new news.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Who are these people?
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Who's that?
I know what I have to know.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I don't think you really understand --
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Right.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
Object!
Hello.
They hate each other --
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
Who's the pigeon?
Excuse me?
Triple!
No frown lines.  New watch?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
I assume this is on Rex?
You just haven't met the right person.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
She held that against you?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
Did you just propose to me?
No.
I don't have a ring!
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I want to nail you ass.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
Please! Leave the house.
Marylin!
We are. And it's winding down.
Do you need a Tagamet?
You used his credit card.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Of Massey Myerson?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Well what does he want?
My client has ruled that out.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Mr. Rexroth.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
I knocked several times.
Oh, yes. I heard.
No, I'll go through with it.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Why, noI  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
I didn't ask for your advice. 
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
You always want to run everything.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
You're crazy.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
You're prejudiced.
But what!
was so scaredthat it scared
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
You think it's simple, huh?
Amazing.
You! Don't make me laugh.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Any luck?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Yeah!
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Get out of here!
You're drunk.
I am, Joe.
You send telegrams here?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Zeke.  Git!
What's up?
Orange, New Jersey.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
There were no phone records.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I did.
Why?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why?  What's wrong?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
And Shaw?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
No, you don't!
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
David Ferrie.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
You know who the mayor was?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Allen Dulles?
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
His name?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
That's all you've had all this time?
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Virginia.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Can I help you?
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
What's she willing to give us?
Can I have a word with you?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
This is your money?
What's this?
How was your flight?
I'd love one, but not there.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
What did they want to know?
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Uh-huh.
'74, I think.
Are you?
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
It's different with men.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.
And Annette's it for you?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
In a dress.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
What do you tell Nicolet?
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
I know.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
We can look into that.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
You think I'm kidding?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
I do okay.
How the fuck they know that?
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
Who?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
What does she think she's gettin?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Detroit.
Must of made quite an impression.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
As low as two.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Yeah.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Uh-huh.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
We went to the parking lot.
That's right.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
That's Winston. He works here.
It's in my bag.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
I need your name and address.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
She got off, huh?
In a way, yes.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Turn left.
Yeah.
Get me out of here.
I'm alive.
Then what are you doing here?
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
Della?
Well, how do I look?
Hello, Sam.
Daddy!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you mean?
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
Dr. Carlson's dead?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
Ah!
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Who did?
Jake, is that you?
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
And look what I got.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Oh, come on. It's early.
Why? What for?
He's coming right over.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
I can't do it.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
He said you didn't have one.
Bullshit!
I promise.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
Then don't bug me.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Shows how much you knew.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Total delirium.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Hello.
Jacob Singer?
It's not worth it. You'll never win.
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Why not?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Bring it in.
Is he all right?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Goodbye old friend.
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Minimal.
Can't shut em' down from here.
What?!
The hull's imploding!
Done!
Where is...?
It bought us some time.
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
We're screwed!
That's why I'm here.
Rizzo, you okay?
Did you like it?
It's time.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Now this is getting exciting.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Hurry! She's lost it!
What are you doing?
No.
Barbie from hell...
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Kay-em you okay?
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Then open the doors!
What?!!
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
This is Matt Hooper...
The wire's showing!
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Have you ever had one do this?
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Can you do that?
Home... New York?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Why?
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
He ate a car?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
I hope we get some more help.
What the hell?
Think the tide's with us?
Just keep kicking.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
Leg of lamb this time?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
You love sharks?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Thanks for the message.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
I don't know...
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
I try really hard, actually...
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
No... I guess not.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Cool it.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Viscera?
Oh.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Consider it your musical education.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
You should try Adderall.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
What?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
What?!
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Aw, please Junebug?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What?
I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
What would be a good time for you?
We're actually, finally doing this?
...Yeah.
You took this picture?
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Turkey mostly.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Yeah?
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
If you say so.
So tell me... what happened here?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
What is it?
There's more...
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Any word from that gallery?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Where's Adele?
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
What is it?
Were they wearing condoms?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Darcy?
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
I know what you mean.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Why I give pennies?
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Sup. Sup.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
You have?
I was lookin' for you all day today.
How do you know?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
No...
What?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
What?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Yep.
Yep.
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
You've heard the stories right?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
You are!  I don't like you.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
I wouldn't know.
No it wasn't.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Hello, Peter.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Why not?
Hello?
But you said you didn't know her.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Just for that no hint today.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Very good.  How did you know?
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
What scars?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
Why did he?
Why did he what?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
I know he really likes you.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
How long she been dead?
Well?
What do you think he did?
But we heard him.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I know you're busy so I'll get right to it.  Did you know her?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
A building?
He knows you're aware of that.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Whatever's on your mind.
Bainbridge Books.
When I was very young.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
You mean like in the steam room?
You're not?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
Fine.
What?
I don't have to go through with it either.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
That's worse.
You must move away from the Center.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
The White Castle has fallen.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Yes.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
The Beast will kill her.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Would you desert your friends?
He didn't join them. They joined him.
Freylag's stronghold?
It is important to assure the succession.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
A fine match.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
Who speaks that name!
You had a son.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Take...
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
Not taken.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
A little...
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Poor darling, and then?
Messina.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
No...
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
It's impossible.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Can it kill me?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
It's a special day isn't it?
The new store?
Anything?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
I know where my heaven is.
Where?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Why know?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
Where am I?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
It's yours.
I really want that watch.
This isn't right.
...Noooo.
Coffee?
No.
No.
Water?
Water?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
You what?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
If I was I'm sorry.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
This is the home of an angel.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Don't you like me, Ben?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
How are you doing?
What was that all about?
Can we just forget it?
Please!
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
I like it here with you.
Let's stay for a while.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
I've been all right.
Where have you been staying?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
Go to hell.
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
No. I was in the shower.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
Come again?
Is everything okay?
What?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I'm sorry?
Yes?
I don't know.
You can't even imagine.
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
What's the point?  Look at me.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Here. You're gonna need this.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
I can't.
What the hell is that for?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Neither.
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Of course.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
I completely agree.
No.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
You go where?
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Three months.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Elle?
You go to lady now?
What do you want with me?
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Why have you brought me here?
Damn you!
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
You come stealee tleasoo?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Don't you care about what's happened?
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
What do I do?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
By the grace of God.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Fine-looking army.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack.  Sigurd's sword is no great thing.  The Volsung killed Fafnir.  You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
God's blessing.
We'll find it.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
Easily spoken...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
The wound is mortal.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Can't we move any faster?
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
Go on... go on...
I'll try.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
A gentleman would offer water.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Jack!
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Tis the truth.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
You've freed me, Jack...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Lili... I love you!
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
No!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Simple as that, eh?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
You've been inside?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
He hasn't called?
Red.
You're a good girl.
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
You should stay.
Where's your dad?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Huh?
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
I was wondering.
I thought I was helping you.
You hate your father.
This is such a street of whiners.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
Are you guys' friends?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
That would take weeks.
I'm good, thanks.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
I've been here twenty years.
Maybe...?
How old are you?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Well, I feel better about this now.
What can I do for you, George?
Thank you.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
George, this is the third time.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Probably in the bible.
It bugs me.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I know.  Why?
I know the feeling.
Are you talking?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I still don't know what that means.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
Can you build a house in four months?
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
She's a little sad, is all.
Four days.  I left to think.
But you can't call me while you think?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
It's been a while.
That was the truth.
What are you doing home?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I never asked for more.
The door was open.
Queer.
What did you say?
Nothing R, okay?
Go tell your father we're eating.
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
Is Mae Rose okay?
And the baby?
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Sure, boss.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Nothing.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What do you want, Claude?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
You drew this?!
We'll just get off at the next stop.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
It's a pardon from the governor.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
You sure it was him?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
How you doin'?
You ever done time before?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Where am I at, man?
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Appreciate it.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
You shouldn't have come here.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Now will you get in the flask?
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
No!
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Where did you meet my father?
It's not me, moron.
Makin' friends already.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Release the evil?
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
I mean... tough break.
So go get 'em, Dad!
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
It's Stanley, sir.
There's our man.
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Why are you laughing?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Sometimes, sure.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Are you dead?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Why is that funny?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you send them?
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Your own work?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Here.
And now?
About what?
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
That's tomorrow.
Of course --
Uh-uh.
I'm ashamed. I was bringing you to be killed.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
What do you suppose this was...?
I'm afraid.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
And Sanctuary?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
What people?
What's that?
Hello, Sandman.
Are there any other humans?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
More... many more.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Why not?
Me, too.
He'll kill us.
I don't know.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
You all right?
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Yes, I believe so.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
You don't look so good.
Yeah? what did they want?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I want to see him.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
What's the matter?
What is it?
I like to laugh, Fred.
Yeah?
You're up early.
What the hell is going on?!
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
We just killed a couple of people...
You really don't remember?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Yes, sir.
A paleontologist.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Just call me Barney.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
It's unbelievable.
Huh?
No.
Hey, what's happened to you?
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including  the excess of virtue itself.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
You're startled?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Oh, I'm so glad.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Splendid!
Yes.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Just what I needed too.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
George, come back!
What about the porters?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
So you think I'm mad?
Is that all my story meant to you?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
What's she got to do with it?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
What if he refuses?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
What do you suggest?
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Thank you.
I'm thirty.
Ouch!
Struggling, why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
What is it?
Thank you.
Hesitated, sir.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
Well this didn't.
All the time, sir.
Sir--
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
We wear black.
It's a bug.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
what's this?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Looks like a train ticket.
What's going on, Kay?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
He's here to help!?
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Since how long?
Would you call this a code 100?
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
What are you doing?
They respond to fear, right?
Not bad.  Briliiant, actually.  You come unarmed, and alone.  Cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
It's... coming.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
They're gone.
I'm getting a trajectory...
Actually, I don't know...
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
I'm sorry, but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Can you see the balloon man?
I have to go back.
She died?
What --
Found?  Where?
It's all I could safely move.
The nano... what?
You the sentry?
Hence the expression...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I go running down there.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I'm not getting halo'd.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Everybody runs.
No maglev system.
Sir?
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
Just a nickname.
Flaws.
She spoke to me.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Who are you?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Why?
You want to bring it down.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
John?
He's dead, Lara.
I thought you were retiring?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
How did you get this?
It's the same prevision.
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
How many?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
What about your meeting?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
That was our apartment.
They've never been separated before.
What does he want with a precog?
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
You're Bobby, right?
Not on me, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
What if I gave you forty?
Women?
I don't get it. What do you do?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
Holy shit.
Is he cute?
Bullshit.
She's, uh, sleeping.
What's wrong, baby?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
I'm ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
When's it going down?
Ruiz tied in out there?
Where we going?
Where's Ricky?
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
Then what are you saying?
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Where's the drop?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
No. Just the cross streets.
I can wait around if you want.
It's important.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Can you check?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
He didn't say we need guns.
He implied it.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
You wanna go right now?
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
I like it.
Who you calling?
How much was it?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
What the fuck was that about?
Hi.  It's Ruiz.  Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
Where?
What are you doing.
You're out of money?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
What about it?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
I don't want to take any more chances.
What?
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
The videos.
Why? What I say bad?
See you later.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
So you're our own private guy?
No. What is it?
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
Keys.
What about my keys?
You want... Why are you picking on me?
Who's gonna outfit us?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Man, what do you want?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
What the hell for, man?
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I sure met some.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
What?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
What?
Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
The talk is everywhere!
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Just what is your question?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
Entirely.
Let me do it then.
I say a lot of things.
'Bout every other night, Red.
What mission?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You're my father.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You evil this morning.
That's a fine chick.
Fine as May wine.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
You're too small to be Bogart.
That ain't bad.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
So you are going to talk me to death.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
So what do I get in return?
I need something. Do you have banking connections?
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
[Si.]
[Daniel.]
[What is his name?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Where do I find him?]
[What do you mean?]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
What is it?
How does it affect you?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Pinta...
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Potential? I don't understand.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
Could I stop you?
You've done much of this work before?
Creasy... Wait.
Where are you?
What was her name?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[You have the money.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Yes, mom?
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
She likes him.
Creasy.
That's ridiculous.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[Who's that?]
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You helped him get this job.
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Yeah, sure.
I'll call her up.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Oh.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Ufa!
Ah?
Who?
When was this?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Yeah.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
We just live one flight up.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Sure, what?
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
What nurses?
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
He coming home right now.
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Tommy!
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
So long, Ho-Jon.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore   House. You in the market Duke?
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Any time. Whenever we want.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
We think the same way.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Ravenous. What about you?
But what about Major Houlihan?
I think I heard about that.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We stand behind all our work.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
That's right. We work well together.
The bastards outconned us.
What's the matter?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You're asking for somebody else?
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Sir?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Yeah?
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
Huh?
Me?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Oh!
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
That's good.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
The letter.
What letter?
There is no letter.
Say that again.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Well, maybe you're right.
Okay, fellows.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Where is she?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
What?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
No!
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Four bits.
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
I want it as soon as possible.
What's your name?
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Did you want to see her about something important?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
Don't make do it, Mike.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
I won't get away with it.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
Tell my dad.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Automatic.
What's the suspect's name?
You don't have to come here.
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
It's all there.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
I don't really like to drink.
You got a girlfriend?
Get good at it.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
The 6 horse is still last.
How long you been coming here?
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
Yeah?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Stay here, don't move.
Scottie...
Scottie?
Yeah.
Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
Depends. What's up?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Repoed this morning.
Yes.
God-Damn you!
She said I have a son...
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
What's happening?
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Where you plugged-in from?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
Because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  I mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just God-Damned sick of this world --
Why would I do that?
There was no need to kill her.
What?
I'm sorry.
Why not?
Voice activate.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Program name?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Wow.  Sand.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
NEW POWER COINS!!
There goes the neighborhood.
And how do we do that?
Look closer.
Hey, boss!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
How'd you know?
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
The goddamned bastards.
Poor, yeah.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
You scare me, Charlie.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Well...
I'm already late.
Something came up.
It's a mask.
Would it be painful for you?
Meyer just finished the books.
I'll handle the Boss.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
He's an animal!
What about the share.
They do what I tell 'em.
Masseria's been after me too.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
The Big Picture.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Who did this?
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
DEATH!!
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
You're really gonna pop the question?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Stu?
The ring...
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
So, what do you think?
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
What about the fellow in those pictures?
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Mother!
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
I see.  How much?
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
I did not--
Never.
It couldn't be.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- *me*, carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Yeah. What about the second act?
"There's more light here," he says--
Waiter!
Shut up, Diz.
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Yeah, I know. That's okay.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Huh?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Henry Hill.
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Y-yes, Jim.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Mr. President--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Hello, Jefferson.
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
*No*!
Most natural thing in the world!
Whose statue is that?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
About two hundred of the most beautiful acres that ever were! Mountains, prairie land, trees, streams! A paradise for boys who live in stuffy cities--  You don't know that country out there, do you, Miss Saunders?
Since sixteen or so.
Why?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
No!
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Already? All these letters?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Saunders--!
What are you going to do?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Hurray!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Oh--you are!
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Yeah?  And what else?
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
Pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Thank you very much.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
What?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
What did you mean by that?
You have?
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
Huh?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
How'd you get the picture?
Sure.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Gold, eh?
Yes, sir.
I wish you luck, sir.
I wanna see that guy!
Come on, John. What happened?
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
All set.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Why should you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Uh-huh.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Why not?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Proceed.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Farmer?
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
What's that?
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
But she's on the telephone
Me, sir?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Doubtful. What did he say?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Why's that?
I'm fine.
What's that?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Why? I'm paying for this.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
Go to hell.
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
A little.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
I'd better get in there.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
But you know how to drive?
Got a license?  But no car?
Do you think that's a good idea?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
We don't discuss it.
Is this the treatment?
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Disgusting.
Which thing?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Yeah?
I don't know if --
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Hello?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Well, there's Lily.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
It's not?
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
"Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
And a birth certificate is enough?
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
I'm here for you, Doc.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Now go find me a big stick.
Altar boys?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The sun turning black.
And what did he say?
You lie.
Twenty.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
For what?
Not unless you call me Rick.
No... Why?... Should I?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
It's everybody's problem!
I'm staying.
Got it!
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Hey,... don't I know you?
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
That looked rather painful.
We gotta get her back.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
He was the last time I saw him.
Atta, girl!
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
No one will believe us.
Snap out of it!
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
I admire you.
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
It's me.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
My heart died a long time ago.
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Have you ever seen him?
There's just not enough of us.
There's a vague similarity.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Firepower costs money.
We're superheroes.
Are you famous?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
So what can I get you?
But... the silverware?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This looks like a job for Superman --
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
There are none here.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
I don't know, sire.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Read it back.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Bastia -- and you?
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
How did it spread so quickly?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Yes, sir.  Are you acquainted with her?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Good evening, sir.
What's your name?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
May I offer you a drink?
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
I will never forgive you.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
There's probably some explanation.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
I couldn't face telling you.
You couldn't face telling me what?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
Of course, my dear.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Come in.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
Yeah.
Y'all never use it?
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
What's crackin'?
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Why?
Yeah, air.
You're welcome, Unc.
I will.  When can I come visit?
You want us to give you a ride?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Can I help you?
Craig, remember what I told you.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
I got fired too.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Debo!  Debo!
What?
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
That's my girl.
Uh, yes..
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I remember you...in the elevator.
Who did?
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
For not believing you.
Yes, yes, I understand.
Keep your voice down.
You know what I'm gonna do.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
Are you sure?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
You got anything smaller?
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
What?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Oh, Jesus ...
Keep the change.
Well?
What?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Why?
I've got something for you.
Yeah.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Yeah.
No.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
She went.
You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What?
The money, Icey.
You go set down by the River.
What could have possessed that girl!
How?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
Mm-hm.
Can I have milk too?
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
No. No one never did.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Mister Powell?
What do you figure to do?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Harry!
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
This man down at the Drugstore...
What you been up to?
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Slept like a rock.
No.
What happens if they don't do that?
Much better.
Who?
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Rod's not a lunatic.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
What the hell you doing here?
No more fights.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I see.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What do you wear in the morning?
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
What is it?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
The former Duchess!
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Good morning, Gaston.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
Count d'Algout...
Is this satisfactory?
Leon, my little boy.
We don't want to be disturbed.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
And if we have to go to Siberia...
A week?
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
You, please.
Me?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
No.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
And what is your profession?
Ni-notchka.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
The bayonet? Did you really?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It's twelve o'clock.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
I didn't follow you.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Because we are an odd couple.
I wish they had never met.
I promise... I swear.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech.
No! No!
Much happier.
It is their wish.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Those newspaper people?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Well... that's my business, madame.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Thank you.
Yes... leaving immediately.
It's just a place for workmen.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
I understand that, sir.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
This is not a joke, John!
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
So?
That's right ...
But what are we paying him for?
Sir?
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
You never told him?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Sir?
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
We could leverage Helms.
My friends call me "Mister President."
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
... little Bobby.
Ummm...
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
I always get my man.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
Did you cry when he died?
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
POWs.  And their families.
Yes, yes.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Are you serious?
Yeah ... I'm out.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
I don't want them to love me.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Penny for your thoughts.
Congratulations, Dick.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How'd you know I was here.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
Yes, you've circled round.
When did he die?
You're discouraged.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Would you tell me if you had?
Who's he in trouble with then?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Believe you're right.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
No sir.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
...Be careful.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
It's full a money.
Did you buy that gun?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Mm-hm.
I don't know.
All right.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
Yes I do.
You married into it.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
No.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
You already have the tent?
What room?
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'm sorry.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
That's me.
Sugar?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
It's called a transponder.
...What do you do?
Yes.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
What outfit.
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
You should get the order you want.
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Yeah?
Junior year!
Anyway, so what?
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Yes, ma'am.
Did you watch it yet?
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Lyla's very nice.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
David, please --
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
Dr. David Ravell.
She called you 'George,' George.
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Doctor David Ravell.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
What are those for?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
If we're for real?
Relax, we brought the cash.
That is so right.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Where? Where is she?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Isn't that the point?
Seems like a nice place.
Really?
Jesus Christ!
He's waiting...
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
You lie, motherfucker...
- and share one of your graves.
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
What do we do now, Everett?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Four hundred, Delmar.
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Who was fixing to betray us!
The preacher said it absolved us.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
Mama said you was hit by a train!
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
What for?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Good morning, girls.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Hi, son.
Yes, sir!!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Yeah... Mmmm...
Everything was different.
He ask you out for next weekend?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
I know who you are and what you want.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
I'll get it if you want.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
No. Is that what you want?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Why?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
I have the gun.
I can't...
You got an idea?
The hell does she want?
She's gonna handle it.
-- posed to mean?
Not that one.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck!
This was your department, Junior.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Pure idiot.
Be quiet.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
And we're never getting in.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
I mean it!
Everything okay?
Somebody called you?
Oh, I've seen these...
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
That's highly inappropriate.
Too many stairs.
What?!
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
"What we want is in that room."
Small space?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
No...
Like?
What's with you?
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
I don't know. Look around man.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
You want me to put a man on it?
Jesus...
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Yes sir, I did.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Yeah.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
We'll all get out of here together.
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
You don't know him very well, do you?
Excuse me?
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Are you going to meet with him?
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
And the Governor?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Have you seen any Redcoats?
What now, sir?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Oh?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
We saw.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Don't touch him.
It is ended.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
But what about Thomas?
Remember Braddock?
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
No-I guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
What's up, sugar?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
I can hardly read these.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
What say, Louis?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
You keep saying that.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Thank you, Louis.
I got eggs down here!
How does he do that?
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Now?
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Then why aren't you eating?
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
That would hardly be proper.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Nor did you, I noticed.
Exactly.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Dead serious.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
You threatened Miss Swann.
No.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
Come aboard.
It's still against the law.
I swear, you look just like him.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Tortuga?
Shut up, before you lose them all!
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Are you certain this is the right way?
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
... No.
No.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Icky!  What's happening?
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Daniel, what are you doing here?
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What do these replicators do to people?
What's that supposed to mean?
The nanobot... it's not here...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
What's that?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Yes.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Fine. Have a seat.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Gloria Golden?
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Mr. Schuyler .
I'm not quitting!
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes.
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Yes.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
Thanks, thanks.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
How far have you gotten?
To Old Madrid.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
You quit trying to stop anybody
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, come right in.
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
With pleasure, Madame!
Have you seen this? 
And you struck him right here in our house?
Did you call, sir?
You try it.
No, sir.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
You sure you want to know this?
I'm sorry ...
Having kind of a tough time.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
No she's not.
Like a drum.
Oh, George ...
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
So.
I'm busy.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
What do you mean!?
Green.
What are you doing?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Yeah ...
And you're sure about this?
Yeah.
What do we do?
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
... Her father.
Yeah ...
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
BUD.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
EXCUSE ME?
How long do you think you've been here?
I'm going on trial tomorrow?
There's worse places.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
What?
Yeah ...
Aren't you a little early?
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Dream come true, hunh?
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
Somewhere in Utah.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Why?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Yeah I can't.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Hi, is this Jack?
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Are your pants off?
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
...yeah.....
No.
Me?
So you think you can?
-- you said you did.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Not very well.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
What do you do with all this pudding?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
About six months.
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Have a good trip.
About six months ago. Why?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Yeah.
I forgot about that.
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
For what?
Why?
Did you do it?
No.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Sorry about that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Yeah.
Hey.
Please don't do this.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
What is this, man?
Are you serious with this?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
I know.
I know.
I thought Latisha said you would --
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
At your service, Count.
Madeleine --
Has he hurt you?
In part, yes.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
What? What've I done?
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
-- water! --
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Who's to say I did not?
It's a formality; truly.
Well...?
Shut down?
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
I'll do everything in my power --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
-- words alone are insufficient.
Of course.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
Louis
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
There's nothing to explain
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
There is nothing to discuss-
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
I will not have this in my home.
How so?
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Sir?
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
What are movies about?
Nope.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
Fuck you
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
It doesn't have to be
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
Why her?
They don't have to.
And what does he see?
Jesus Christ --
Uh huh.
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
Christ.
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
You gonna watch?
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
Get out
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Then find another theater
It's just that my movie is so-
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I think you better sit down
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
About what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
How can he embarrass you?
What who's been sayin'?
This looks done.
Where you going at this hour?
You're a good sport, lady.
You heard me, I said hit me.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
You wasn't with her, were you?
You wasn't with her?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Whadda ya mean?
Whatsa matter with you?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
You said never to touch you before a fight.
You're not interested in him?
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
With Salvy, eh?
Open the door, Vickie.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
But they don't have a case against you.
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
For instance?
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
A detective's nightmare.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Jefferies.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Like what?
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Why should I?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
That's normal.
You're never going to marry?
People have different emotional levels that --
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
You called the police?
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Yes.
Not too active.
I wish there was one I wanted.
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
What's the apartment house number?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Something on your mind, Lisa?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Machismo?
Sure.  It's fine.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Mother--
We don't have time.
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
Have some cigars.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
What's that pounding?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
No.  I don't think so--
Boy!
Jim!
There's only one key.
Man, you're schizoid!
That's swell.  How are you?
No.  At dawn.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
No.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
They never do.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
What?
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Bully for you.
Yeah--why--
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Why?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
You disappointed?
You smell like baby powder.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
He hates me.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Must have a way with stationery.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
To all those cons...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
No, c'mon --
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
We could live it up and --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
Nick, no --
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
Nick, I love you --
Nick...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
What college.
A station wagon in Canada.
Christmas... Eve...
What?
I said, who the hell made the map?
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
What's the code?
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
That motherfucker --
Hell yeah. You work here long?
My what?!
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
What about the money?
You knew there were guns in here!
Merlin, I didn't know --
Hell you haven't.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Thought you hate your old man.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Ash... Ashley...
How'd you know I'd do it.
Do what?
POP! That was My card!
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Yes.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
But what is this?
Just hold on buddy boy.
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Mr. Blue's dead?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
Give me my book.
Sorry, it's my book now.
That's your proof?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
I know.
Freddy Newendyke.
I'm okay.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I don't believe in it.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Well, he knows a little about me.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Of course.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
This must have been in the family a long time.
You can't leave us here.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
So am I.
Yeah.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
You're not going out to look for them?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
Maybe it's better that way.
I -- lost something.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
You got no business snoopin' around --
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
I said let's go.
Put on another one.
What comes after Z?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
I think he wants me.
Me, too. 101?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
It's coming!
Hey, you left your book back there.
No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants.
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Then what are we going to do?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
This can't be happening?
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
I'm sorry.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
Did you do that?
Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head?
I don't like this, this...
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Professor!
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
The image there.
Professor, we need to talk.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
That's right.
Yours, or the turkeys?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
No thanks.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Yo son, check this out.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
What a bitch!
You don't think...
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Oh Mom...
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
You mean for TV or print?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Hello.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
I do, please.
Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
That's like your car, Beverly,
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
No.
How much does she want?
I'll give you a check.
Why, Mary --
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
What's wrong, Mary?
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Uhhuh.
Perhaps.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Because I have something very important to do.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Sister older or younger?
Why is that?
You're what?
Does it bother you?
You had sex with you therapist?
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Donna?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Like what?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
Maybe you want to go.
Yes.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
You said you weren't always impotent.
Her name was Elizabeth.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
I'm babbling.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
I can't.
I've told you.
No.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Don't do that.
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I'm not either!!
Loud.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
No, he left last week.
Did you find him attractive?
Yes.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
He doesn't have a phone.
What are you talking about?
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
No!
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Then why'd you call me?
Apparently.
He wouldn't do that.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't give you my address?
Talking.
You just want to ask me questions?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Were you disappointed?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
No? Not even one more?
No.
I would.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
I'm intrigued.
Hello.
John Millaney.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Did he put you up to this?
I know. Will you please leave now?
Plus first and last month deposit.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
IBM.
John Millaney.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Hi. Want a drink?
But where are you going?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
How's Brad?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
SIN-I-FUL
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
We're the experts.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
That's us.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Absolutely correct.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
The fuck was that?
Bye.
Miles.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
So I guess that's it.
What do you think?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Anything I'd know?
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
That's your problem, Miles.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
This is rose, right?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
She works for tips!
Nice, huh?
Get the trunk.
Aye-aye, captain.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Nice shot.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Huh. Let me think.
What's that?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Yep. Quite a day.
No, I'm okay.
Come on, let me drive.
I'm fine. You rest.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Is she sleeping or...?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Okay.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
About a year.
French or American?
Sir, what are you doing?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
It makes me feel better.
This one?
Hi sweetie.
Does it hurt?
Pharmacy crowded?
Morgan, be careful.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
He was only a year and half old.
Me too.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
We might lose the signal.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Bimboo?
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
Where are we going to sleep?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
And three weeks.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
Jake, I'm going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
Emmett.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Forget it.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
Where are we?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I haven't done anything.
Offend anybody lately?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Where's Turley?
Doesn't look quite fair.
It's not going to be easy.
No hard feelings.
Where is Rae?
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Why?
What now?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
Luck, I guess.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
Who's the owner?
What makes you say that?
I've got a place I can hide her.
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- What's wrong with that?
The public decides who's on that list.
-- It's called a projector.
You're not renewing my contract.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
Almost right.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Even the fall from the plane.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Impossible.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
There's... a wall between you --
Not like this --
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
She still with Kent?
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I do.
I read.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
This is the story.
I'm keeping it in trust.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
My God, you've got one?
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Good.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
What were they hiding from?
No.
...No.
I don't know, Cole.
You weren't a paper champion.
What are you thinking, Momma?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Yes, Cole?
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I happen to be a professional.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Curt Cobain.
Yeah, man. You were wrong, Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Ow!
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
So?
No Mac, please... I --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Second verse!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Pretty, ain't they?
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
You took Bill.
Where are you?!
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
What can I do you for?
All the rib eyes?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Who's that?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Can I ask you something?
Mississippi's the other way!
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Ummm?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
See.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
This is Bandit I. Over.
That's the point, Dickey.
Five thou.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Really?
Are you on a land line?
Your attitude sucks.
Do you want me to say I did it?
That's probably him now...
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
-- You can and you will.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...When did you know all this?
...So you made another deal?
Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
... Jesus... what for?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
What were you doin' here anyway?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
What else did Padiche say?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Yes.
You killed her!
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
He's dead.
Where's Sartorius?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
And professionally?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I love her.
I wasn't.
Stop it.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it intelligent?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
You still don't believe in God?
Why did you say those things?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
Do I really feel like... I am...?
Was she right?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
What's happening to us?
It's all right.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Rheya --
No.
Thank you.
I can't stay here.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
You want it coming back with us?
Straight ahead.
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Sooner, the better.
He said he'd kill me.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
Yeah.  It was.
But "nice".
I can't open it.
Let go!
I do care about you!
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Long enough.
Claire...
Mike?
So how'd it go?
I can still use a gun.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
What did she say the down payment was?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
What?
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
What about Tommy?
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Under the table.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Lay back, Mack.
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
And Flash isn't?
Oh, sure.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Now tell me you love me.
Mr. Jameson--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Frmpph-yrr.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
Good morning, Liz.
Huh?
I-- uh--
I hate--
My my.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
You should write that one down.
Peter?
Toxic dumps, huh.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
I am old enough to--
I'm a photographer, remember?
It's Friday night...
Absolutely no class.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
How is he?
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Actually, I got this spider bite
I don't think I'll be running into him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Like it?
So they're airing this tonight?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Break it off!
What is your number?
I'll live.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What exactly is he charged with?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
Interesting.
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
What's the award?
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You'll fix me up!
You did?
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
Anything else?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
What radio?
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says who?
Right.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
We have no radio.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
What guy?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
That is my wife.
Have a nice time over there?
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
What do you mean?
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
This is its current position.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Are any of them inhabited?
Population?
I get it. I get it.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
Close to retirement?
Oh
And what would that be, sir?
But I do have a theory...
A photon torpedo?
Aye.
Sir?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
Aye, sir.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Nothing. As before.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Short range scan.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Later. Let's go...
That may be difficult...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
What's wrong?
The Genesis planet is gone.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
You would have done the same for me.
Why would you do this...?
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Would you look at that?
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Yours...?!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You should take the Vulcan, too.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
... He spoke of your friendship.
What you ask is difficult.
Share this with no one.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
Maybe...
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Admiral Kirk...
What?
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Inoperative.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Just barely, sir.
Try the emergency channels...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
That's it?
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
You earned it.
Yes.
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Admiral on the bridge!
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
I can't get power, sir!
Prepare for warp speed.
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
... Best shot...?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Like what?
Name?
I do not know your name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Can you protect us?
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
You mean man...
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
I buy that. What about him?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
We don't want to be any trouble.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
So. There we are.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
Oh my God, we're too late!
Thank you, Admiral.
Spock...?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Any luck...?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
No power to the bay doors.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Why?
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
There are days.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
... an offlander?
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Yes... that looks like them.
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation.  This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Fail-safe?
That's your expert opinion?
I don't think they believe us.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Say the greeting again...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
Come in.  Hi.
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes...
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
How long has he been unconscious?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Captain, the Enterprise!
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Active.
Yes.
Invasion.
There is no invasion...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
Were the two of you... involved?
Life signs?
Captain...?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Return to our own time?
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
Right.
We've lost Bridge control!
Someone...?
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
If they're even looking for us...
Damned clever if you ask me...
We're explorers not diplomats!
Barely.
My God, what happened here?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
I checked the data banks, yes.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
What took you so long?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
And your coat.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Except us.
This is incredible -
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Kronos, sir?
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Captain, our shields -- !
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
The peace conference.
I SHOULD have been -
WE SURRENDER.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
A computer canna lie, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No. Can I move now?
No. I must deactivate you.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
Not tonight, I have work here.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
Good work. The download?
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Counselor.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
How could I not?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Counselor?
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Deanna, on my mark.
I'll take care of it, sir.
Understood.

Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
What's this?
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Anything.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Yes.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
Hello, Jean Luc.
You're not Reman.
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
I am.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
He's a very unusual android.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Intruder alert!
This is a mistake.
Find her again.
How long until we reach the Rift?
Praetor...
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
Sure.
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
Shermin...
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
This is George Fox...
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Mrs. Haydn...
What?
What?!
What?
What?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Shit?
I will see it next time.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Eh... yes...
I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Yes?
I don't understand 'friend.'
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
On the radio they say it's good.
I will go. But not you.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
But...
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
Yes.
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
My grandmother's rich.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Bullshit!
Very beautiful country up here...
It was a man though... right?
Is there a reward in this?
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Fuck you.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You can't just... kill him.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
He has his uses too.
Damn right.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
What?  Right Here?
That's not sayin' much.
I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly.  Broken hearts are for assholes.
You should feel like shit.
Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Top ten.
Looks like she was holding out.
He's been cooked-off
What stuff?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
Your sex life?
Sleaze to peddle.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
So that gives you something.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Lenny, give them the tape.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
This is bad.
Well, look at the plus side.
I'm not going.
What is that?
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
You run the plates?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Who knows.
This isn't in our database?
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
I have 6 tons.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
What are you...?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
What's that?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
There are Agency regulations about this.
What did you tell him?
Just routine stuff.
You mean --
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Jaime? Where are you?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Yeah, of course.
It's quite advanced.
How's the arm?
I don't carry it with me.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
I screwed up twice, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
How far is Amarillo?
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
I know, I know.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Hi.
Yes. Like the quiche.
Anything?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
The poor thing. Six years?
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Why not?
Me too.
I would love to see you again sometime.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
...It's really getting late.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Are you on the other line?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Why didn't you call?
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
You don't call.
So what's the difference?
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
What do you want? You're tall.
Oh no?
I didn't mention her once today.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
You want to hit the town tonight?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
What'd you get?
An eight.
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
Bud.
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
What's the point?
Well, you're doing so well...
I didn't make it...
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
S'up Trent?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Always.
Yea, how much?
That was so demeaning...
I know she's coming back.
She likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That was different.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
No. Doesn't that suck?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
What a surprise...
It's on.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...You're just poking at it...
...honestly...
It is on.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
I ask for Justice.
The Court gave you justice.
Barzini.
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
No.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
I'm going to finish school.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You wanted me to be your son.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
We're all tired...
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Don't you want dinner first?
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Cut it out.
And all his works?
Buy me out?...
You're unlucky.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Is he alive?
Well, we ate everything without you.
Is that good?
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Who's this?
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
This is so good of you.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
No!
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Freddie drove me back in his car.
I'm prepared to take the blame.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Really? To Italy?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
I hope she never knows.
I never said that!
What does that mean?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Did he kill Freddie?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Where does Dickie live?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Hello Marge!
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
So you found Peter...
What's funny?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
You're kidding.
So -- are you travelling under R?
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
It's okay.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
Tom, are you okay?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
You're such a liar...
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
November 7th is my information.
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Thank you.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
That's an expensive gun.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
How much for everything.
Is there a firing range around?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
I bought a couple of tickets.
This is sort of high class...
I mean porno movies.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Just what?
No, why?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
No, I'm serious, really...
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Stick up?
Huh?
What's your real name?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I can leave anytime I want.
He looks like a killer.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What should I do? Call the cops?
I can't sleep nights.
You moonlightin?
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Who?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
No.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
What, vou?
What about you, Delly?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
How'd they get it inside?
We were in love... weren't we?
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Delly, shhhhhh...
Sir, that is true.
Yes, sir.
Yes it does.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Harry, son.  Harry.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
A few.
Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
I was decorated.
That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
When was that?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Oh.
Oh...
I suppose.  Thanks.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
What do you mean?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Because she was afraid.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Is anyone there?
Mom, they're in a cage!
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
I know.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
I wonder if you could help me.
See them two big trees across there?
It's a surprise, you see.
Yep?
Yes.
You did say birds?
Lovebirds, I see.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I know, Mother.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
But they'll be back.
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
They won't be.
If they are?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Where's Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
That's a chimney swift, all right.
What's more likely, they got in the room and was just panicked, that's all.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Yes.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Lovebirds, sir?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Criminal.
Yes.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Seven o'clock then.
He was watching a ball game on television.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
No.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
I wrote the letter.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'm glad you do.
What?
Are you all right?
Are you staying?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
The bay doesn't.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
There we are!
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I don't know why.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Scotch, light on the water.
I'm Donald Fettes.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
Aye.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
Well --
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
No.
What's that you say?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
I will not have you use that name to me.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
The nerve centers -- the brain --
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
But where did they get those people?
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But can anything be done for her?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
Aye --
Two down. Two to go.
Fuck! What do you want?
Where the fuck did you come from?
What did they give you?
No! Why are you haunting me?
Are you ok?
But you, you've had them.
Why are there so many?
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
They killed her because she found out.
Sweetheart...
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Yes, I have!
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
No -- I'm afraid not.
I don't believe it.
Just Klaatu.
The present situation?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
Well, we could--
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
What happened?
No. That's all finished.
I'm sorry.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
Can't stand light?
Good.
We were gonna grab some food.
You can't kill me, Star.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
What?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Of course not!
David.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
He's just a deep sleeper.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
Smells like something died.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Nowhere.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Sixteen.
Dogs don't eat each other.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
What?
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Torch it over there!
MacReady!
What clothes?
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Spaceship of some kind.
I guess you're okay.
In this weather?
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
He might just wait us out.
This storm do that?
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
Calm down and get in your position.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
What's happened?!
MacReady, that you?
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Vox --
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
Why?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
I need to... um... talk to you.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex, what is it?
Let's walk through the park...
Heavens, look at that now!
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
In the future, we'll be better.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
I'm sorry, David.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
Hiding?
His curiosity is amazing.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.
Yes.
And this is your "work"?
I can see Kalen's point.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
What do you mean?!
Sir, if I may --
And you've no idea where he went?
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] You don't believe me, do you?
Relax.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
We are not birds of a feather.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Yes.
They're not here.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
How'd he get it?
You have no idea what's going on.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
What about the world?
And how do you know that?
Who told you this?
Can you drive?
Yup. That's me.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
This is a great song.
What?
Why?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
We're both fine.
How are things goin' out there?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Alright.
That's certainly possible.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
That sounds nice.
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What did ya do?
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Do you love me?
Not yet.
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Yes.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Give me the keys.
But you think he fools around.
Call him?
Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
You think you've found your calling?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Thelma!
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Eeuww.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Where?!
The thing's kind of heavy.
No harm, no foul?
Whatever happened to Mary?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
And this adversely affects me how...?
I don't know what to say.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
By the way, what's your name?
I already know it, Mary.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Fine. Fine.
A surprise?
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Yeah.
Turn it up, Magda.
All set.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
I think your life's about to change.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Harvard?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
You what?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Oh. Well I am.
Hm?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Why?
Magda!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
What...?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
And did everything -- ?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Twenty-two.
Yeah?
So you're a writer?
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Yeah? What do you want?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
One guess.
Franks and beans!
Starshells.
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
What does the letter say?
And?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
How long until the army is ready?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
I said his heart, not his attention.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Hello?
You're sure...
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Who are you?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Her oil pan is shot.
Bastards...
Tread matches. It's the car.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
What did he say?
What's he smoke in that?
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Ray --
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Not no more.
Crow Horse, listen --
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
1868...
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You take care.
You're the Indian FBI.
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
X22. Read.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Ray. X22.
Good.
Mister Tully.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
No way. No fuckin' way.
And far too aggressive.
For what?
Evan... or Maverick.
Harmless!
What about the plane?
What plane.
Let's make it at eight.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
It's just as I thought.
And now?
You always get what you want?
I want it understood.
Food...and you...my F-14!
Just good luck.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Where are we?
That's what I want.
Want to play the game?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
That's three.
Well?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
You're crazy. We're level.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Not anymore.
I've got it -- hold on!
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Gotta go, man.
That's not what I heard.
The list is long, but distinguished.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Come on, we're next.
What?
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
I'm pinned to the panel.
What'd you do?
A plaque?
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
Nope.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
So have I.
Why?
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
How do you feel?
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You may not think so, but you are.
He was by the book, all the way.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Would you take me back? Would they?
What to the rebels want?
The Last Resort.
What happened to them?
Why not?
But maybe you can change all that.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Do you expect me to believe you?
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Bob?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Hetero.
Brunette.
What do you want?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
You're Kuato, right?
They found us!  Everybody out!
Yeah.
Where?
Are you saying she liked it?
Look at this shit.
Mmmm.....
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Harry from work...He was the boss.
And falling in love?
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
This is too weird.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Like what?
Where are you going?!
What reactor?!
You guys all set?
Ready as we'll ever be.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
How much you think?
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
We're not going over there, right?
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
You're hung up again.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
This is one big mother!
God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Son of a bitch!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
Use the fucking bomb!
Yeah...but no ties.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Burt!  Heather!
Twenty.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
"We"?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
We had a description of the suspect.
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Chinatown street gang.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- What?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
...What do you mean?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
You do.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Racist asshole came at me.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
It was self-defense.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
Y-yes, sir.
This and that.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
-- Every word.
I followed you here from court.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Five years.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
What color hair will she have?
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Here he comes.
Don't get funny with me again.
Let's ditch this place and party.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
An old woman and her grandson.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Where is the ring?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Shorthand. Really?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
That's good.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
I don't know, Sam.
Agent Desmond, it's...
She lived alone.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Noooo...
I don't know what to do.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Maybe I better start our homework.
If I can smoke it.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Laura, I am your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
But I love you, Laura.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
What'll it be?
You got it.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Maybe.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
This afternoon?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Bobby killed a guy.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Eating?
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
I understand.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Where's Dad?
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
You thought it was just.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...he wants to testify...?
I...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Neurology?
Through, through his book.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
I did.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Yes.
Well, many reasons, actually...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
Why is that?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
I'm sorry...?
The most respected...
I understand.
Thank you...
Hi.
Thank you.
I did.
I need an extension for my case.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Ready, your Honor.
And what are you? A cop?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
Do you think it's my fault?
And what makes you so tough?
It's over!
What is that to you...?
You're pressuring yourself...
No.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
How come you're calling me from...?
Pardon?
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Well, well, well. Huh?
Yeah.
Uh...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
I'm going to help her.
They killed her. And they're trying to buy it...
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
...Gruber's not bad.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
The Doctors.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Uh... the admitting nurse...
What did she do?
...yeah... good...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Yes.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Is that it over there?
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Is that... machine...?
They've blocked it!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
That needle ain't pointing north!
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir.  I'm Colonel Heffner.
We will, sir!
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What?
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Diabetes?
These look quite fresh.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Tomorrow night.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
What...what is that?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
What...happened?
I know how Chase really died.
What are you talking about?
Studio B.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Yes?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Black's fine.
Did we lose anybody?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
What?
I can take it.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
Come in.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Fifteen.
What do you mean?
You're not a moron.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You okay?
Congratulations.
Feels different doesn't it?
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Why then.
Hey, shut up will ya?
You only hurt yourself you know?
But that's not the point...
Fine.
Forget it.
Ya know... "It".
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
I don't know.
Who is it Philip?
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Why'd you jump?
No.
What are you blubbering about?
Yes, that's true.
... Absolutely not.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
This be it?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
Ready for another?
Forty bucks...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
That's right... Take one of these.
What is it?
Nice of you to drop by.
You heard from Reggie?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
No... She's fine. Back home.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
In what capacity?
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
And?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
You're perfect for me, too.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
They sure do stink.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You ready for this?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
What's that, peanut?
You're scarin' me, baby.
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Oh God, Sailor.
Sailor?
You sick?
Anything I can do for you?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
He's the kind liked it.
I'll bet.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Get rid of him?
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
In the head.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
What?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Mm.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
You stay there.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his?
So what's the problem?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
Naturally you have copies.
In a sense.
You peeked, didn't you?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Is that in my chart?
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
'Fraid so.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Yes. But that's not why I called...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Goodbye, Grady.
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Sounds like a good one.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Heaven?
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Yea, James.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Glaucoma?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Kinship. And what's here?
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
The hell I am.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
Get out of here.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I thank you.
Jesus.
He cribbed that from Borges.
Yes.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
Not have it.
Really? That was fast.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Sara.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
And what did you say?
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Excuse me?
And?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
A jockey? You mean, like --
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Hey, is that a school?
When can I see her?
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
It was a beautiful present.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
What party?
Soon.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
Is that right?
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
That was terrific.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
I have friends.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Doesn't everybody?
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
What?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I'd say you're moving.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Do you have many friends?
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Yes.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
It's getting dark. Go home.
I said the job is okay.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Reflect.
Try it.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
We have a lot of work to do.
What is your idea of being normal?
What did you think would happen?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Go home, Walter.
I said I was sorry.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Who do you see?
Where are you?
But roughly, how old?
What else?
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
You're quiet at work.
I'm not easily shocked.
Why do you want to know?
You're still here.
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
Hey, there.
Molested little girls?
You mean the time you're locked away?
I'm sorry, Walter.
I was always the one seduced.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
You know, this is crazy.
Most people say the odds are against me.
No you don't.
I say we call it quits.
Don't be scared, Walter.
You okay?
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
You got it?!  You got it?
Nice shot, Lins.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
I can't believe you let them do this!
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
I'm switching off now.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
What do you think he saw?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
He's got the shakes?
You totaled it, huh?
I don't know how!
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hi, lady.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Hello, Brigman.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
How deep?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
But how could you say such a thing?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
Have you decided?
Somebody must live here!
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Find anything?
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
You're very fond of Anna, aren't you?
Are you joking?
Why are you looking at me like that?
What! Get married?
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Have you ever been in love?
To do what?
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
But where did you come from?
Whose boat is that?
And how come you're up so early?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Is that possible?
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Because I'm getting fat.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm being punished.
It's not that... it's not that...
Should you see a doctor?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
You have a lovely voice.
That wasn't me.
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, yes.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
Did it hurt?
I went to my room.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to be?
Why not?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
I can't.
She watches... she listens.
Yes.
Doctor Livingston.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
To be a mother?
I can't tell you that.
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
We went to chapel for vespers.
What is it?
What else?
A crucifix.
Yes.
How did she know about him?
Where?
Yes.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
H... how?
Something they... that they overlooked.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I'll have it.
No, no, no...
Who told you this?
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Two packs a day.
Yes.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
I am not with the Inquisition.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
Who?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
I am...
What?
Oh, some time in January.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
About what?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
The woman's health is at stake.
You just said...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Yes I do.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
This is insane.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
We'd be thrown out.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Eight and two thirds.
Shurrup!
I'm a deserter.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
I don't snore.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
What's up?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
We do.
Is he?
I see.  Do you like the play?
Yes.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Oh aye, a sledge.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
Yeah ... that's right.
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Is that yours?
Well, what are we waiting for?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
What's he know?
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
He's betrayed the class.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Well ...
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Where's Irth?
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Is it solid?
Then take her down.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Computer, what language was that?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
You like this shit?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
It's over, Hunter.
There.  Should be coming through about there.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Sounds like a rough one.
<u>How</u>?
Good!  That's good!
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
The flamethrower!
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
How many?
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Recognizable!  In that?
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
We can use the flamethrower.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Receiving.
It's close, real close.
How far?
Air lock?
What'd he say?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Are they close?
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Where are you?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
It was time for that a couple days ago.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Kill me...
What did it do to you?
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Minh...
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
What do you need?
What's happening?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Deal.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Hey, Guttierez?
What the hell are you doing?
But I'm going first...
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Is this the suit?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
They knocked out the external feeds.
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
What time's sundown?
Give me a yell is something happens.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Yes. I do.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Paved with what, then?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Why'd call me a killer?
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
She was a liar, she was a liar!
No-no-no...
Why not?
We never met. That's why.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
In time she'll be what you are.
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Happy birthday, darling...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
I thought you were going to be late-
I had no idea you were even here.
That never stopped you before.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Thank you.
Addison-!
Okay. Mix.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
What would you like? Texas?
Why what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Lemme fix you a drink.
But she just got here...
Buy some.
Oh, brother.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Why not?
Night an' day.
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
That's all.
Probably not.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
He's the best.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Karen.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
I'll never get over it.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, don't go...
What - again?
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Ain't it the truth?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Do you want it on?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Lloyd, what happened...?
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Now just a minute-
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
What's so funny?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
The play? All right, I guess...
She was a revelation...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Yes, sir.
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
All you got to do is name it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
I didn't hear you.
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Goddamnit--
Anything you've got.
When?
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
You want me to be the bastard.
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
Nah.  Maybe.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
Woodward?
Morning or night?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
You can't.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Absolutely--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
Which people?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
But they both worked at the White House?
How senior?
--what do you think?--
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where?
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Could develop.
Howard--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
...okay...
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Just go!
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
Come on!  I won't tell.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
So we're gonna be close next year?
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
That's not why we're going out.
But that one time --
You think she was serious?
Like a bet?
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
Went home to shit.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
...excuse me?!
Uh...
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Kevin, this is serious!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I think "shithead" really says it.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Like how?
Now?!
Yeah.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
What reputation?
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
That junior chick?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
What?
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Serafine...
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I know. He told me.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What...?
What?
Oh God. Shit...
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
You on drugs? Huh?
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
The ADM. Let's go.
Oh shit... No...
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Andy? Andy is that you?
How well did, er, do you know him?
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
What did she say?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Is everyone all right?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Come on!
Every Russian family has one..
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Trust me, it's her!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
What was that?
So where will you go?
Rasputin!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
I did no such thing!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Why not?
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Tsch.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Alvy, I...
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
Oooh! Here! Here!
Get him!
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Wisconsin.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Nice car.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Fifteen years?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Gimme a kiss.
Really?
Good? I was-
Yeah?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Those are the two categories...
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Oh! Italian, right?
You- Do you love me?
That's the key question.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
What are you doing?
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
Oh.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
W-w-whatta you mean?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Christ!
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Oh-
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You look very pretty.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
Oh!
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
My head is throbbing.
Bad?
You have a raccoon?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Yes.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
Well, sit down.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
The one with the V.P.L.
M'hm.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Yeah.
Did you know the contractor?
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Really.
So where is young Jonah?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
The suspense is killing me.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
You only made half your quote this year.
We'll be fine.
Yes.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
We're great.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
Otis!  No barking!
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
She left the fucking gate open.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
I guess.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
He's my favorite.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
What's a sign for that?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Not long.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
You lose this?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Please, Ryan.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Uh-huh.
No you're not.
Hm.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
What?
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
How long have you been married?
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Ryan.
They're nothing like us.
Ryan!
Do you need anything else?
Thank you.
Do Peter Sellers again.
If he were still alive, maybe.
How?
I wasn't finished.
So tell me, how's it going?
Yes.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
And here they are!
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Yes.
She's such a great photographer.
So where should I put it?
A notch above the storage room.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
I don't have a drug problem.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Are you asking me out to dinner?
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
How should <u>I know</u>?
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
And only you can become a Queen?
So what makes you so special?
And do Princesses do improper things?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
I can't think of any.
This the place?
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Sheldrake?
Care to make a small wager?
Say, you got a lulu.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Eight-thirty.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
What gave you that idea?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
One more?
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling --  -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
No -- I don't want anything.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
As soon as I can walk.
They had to pump it out.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
You sure you want to throw that card?
Sure.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I know so. He's a taker.
Here.
I mean, after that?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I don't know.
That's right, Baxter.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Naturally.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Want to tell me what happened?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Sure, Doc.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
What about him?
That so.
No.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
I don't believe you.
I want you back, Fran.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Where does she live?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
It's a thought.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
My men --
You're out of your skull --
No -- absolutely not --
Two whole drums --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Arch light.
Chef.
A sauciere --
What do you see?
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
How much is left?
Who's he?
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
When'd you do it?
Who knows? Right.
I never heard about that.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
What -- happened here.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
American weapons?
You'll get blown outta here some day.
Boss left.
Wh -- what?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
When did you hear?
Who?
You were not coming here, to see me?
I can handle it.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
I think think a lie stinks.
Go away -- hide yourself.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
And you admired him?
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
You think?
The other one --
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
Simple. They don't want him to go.
What will you do after the war?
I know.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Right now -- I am.
What show ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
134  CONTINUED:
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
That's not what I meant.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Sounds like professional jealousy.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
That's right.  You're not.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Told you I'm fine!
I already have.
Shut up!
Can you walk?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
There's what they're waiting on!
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Go ahead.
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Spencer.
You're not worried that someone might take him?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Uh, Udall?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
No... no thank you notes.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
I want you to go on this trip.
I can't. I work.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Stop asking everyone.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
I'll never forget you said it.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
I'm sorry... are you okay?
I've got to sketch you.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
How's Verdell doing?
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Absolutely.
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
How're you doing?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Please, just leave.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Not it at all, really.
Another place where?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
What's it mean?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
I ain't scared of you.
What?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
The contract?
Get on the expressway.
Ten million --
Another contractor.
He wants to kill you?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
It's not the same, is it?
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Jesus -- why?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Why not?
They tried to kill you?
Yes.
No.  Just the first one.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
I don't know.
Do you think he's here?
What do you think he's doing?
Sorry.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
But he won't shoot you right then?
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I told you, he will.
Ten years later, here you are again.
They're worth less points.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
She was taken.
No.
What?
I waited another four minutes.
What?
Jesus!  Why didn't you tell me?
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
Sometimes.
Do you believe that?
How much farther?
A dime.
Average.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Don't know.  That's how it works.
Of course, senor.
So how's your work?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
An alternative literary venue!
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Let's split.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
No, not yet.
No, the boyfriend.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
Now you're using that word.
Yeah, somewhere?
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
You don't understand, I can't!
You're sure?
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
No!
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Will it help to get you out?
If you get out can we be together again.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Will they free me?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
It was the biggest I could find.
Would you like your things now?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Sure!
So, he didn't fire you?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
Very well.
What if they expel you?
You saw him?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
Thanks.
A late night or an early morning?
Yeah.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I told him to leave me alone.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
Were?
-- This play means a lot to me.
Like me.
No problem --
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
You're not in a very good mood.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
It's not.
You don't know what you want --
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
We can measure wind.
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
When did you build this?
Where's the one you're building?
I don't care.
I'm sick.
Why didn't you tell me?
I should have told you sooner --
By accident --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
You've been well?
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Yeah.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Oh yeah.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
'Bike fine point?'
AM or PM?
Oh, right, right... 
Then where the hell is he?
The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
Marty, that would alter history.
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor? Professor Brown?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
You didn't?
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Obviously!  
Pretty, isn't it?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
I run this place! 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Gone?... Where?
Okay.
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Well, Kit...
Good luck to you.
No, you're not either.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
You still in school?
My stomach's growling.
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I don't know.
What'd you put him in there for?
Yeah.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
No.
I just don't want to go.
Hi.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hold it right there.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Got a casualty list?
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Pick those up, Reno.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
I see.
...I know this must look... funny.
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Hah!
Well that's what he said.
It's still a little early for me.
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man  to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent  don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
What's that?
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
A souse!
I don't understand-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
What do you mean, Barton?
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Can be. Not easy, but 
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Barton. Are you all right?
I've gotta call the police  or you could call for me 
You gotta believe me 
Jesus, Charlie, I...
Sure, Charlie.
...Where did we put him?
I'm at the Earle.
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
...Yes, thank you.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Must be.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
What did... What did he 
Charlie... Charlie's back...
All of which he's now missin'.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Where were you tonight?
How is your -- personal life?
No?
Catherine Tramell.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Were you with him last night?
Did you leave the club with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
She wiped out her whole family.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
What's it about?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Yes.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
Why take the risk?
How's your new book?
You shouldn't play this game.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
Did you miss me?
How did it end?
I hate rugrats.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Did you ever tie him up?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Nilsen?
What kind of talk?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
You don't like punk rockers?
I don't believe it.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
You look like dogshit.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Fuck you, Phil.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
It was an accident.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Why do you think he's dead?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Let's get out of here.
What about the shit they write?
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
You name it, I paint there.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Who did this?  Who did this?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
Yes, but as a black painter 
What?
We don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
You're shattering all my myths.
What's the rush, John Henry?
I ain't John Henry.
I don't really have any problems.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I thought you hated this place?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're 
What's your name, man?
Some of them.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
What time is it?
A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
'Phillips head,' right?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
How could you?  I'm a woman...
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
First you're gonna shut up.  Then you're gonna turn yourself in.
You're not the Mayor.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
And a very, very good one.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Is there something wrong, sir?
But I can't can I?
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
What seems to be the problem?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
What are you talking about?
What exactly are you doing?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
How did you...?
No beauty...
If we could relay the sunlight-
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
That's gotta hurt.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
She wants to kill you.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
What do you mean?
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Scholarly research?
He ran away?
The _Rolls_?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
What now sir?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
So glad you could come.
La'chiem.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
Still play with dolls, Doctor?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
That kid is amazing.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
Bruce, you can't.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
... Murderer...
I know. I called them.
I loathe bats.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Well.  A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice.  And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio.  Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Keep her on the line!
What now?
All this apparatus, Vicki... This house, and the money, and the power ... It was never mine. It was something I inherited. Bruce Wayne was something I inherited.  All I ever hoped for was someone who could see through Bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
You are on drugs.
Yeeees?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Do we know anything about him?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
Jesus.
Let's get a coffee.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
oh dear.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Yes, isn't he.
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Maybe two cars.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Interesting suit.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
What?
What a dork. Huh huh.
No it wasn't!
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
That's not that much.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Butt-dumpling...
Turd-burglar...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Um... ass... head...
Beavis.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
No, Jane.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
That's how long you were gone.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Honey.  Let's go.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
What time is it?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Are you available?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
We're very unhappy.
About what?
Tell the truth.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.

What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
It wasn't a joke.
That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
What's happening to them?
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
... And please call me Robert.
No, Robert.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Good night, Chauncey.
Your leg must be getting better.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
I see.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
To watch...? To watch me...?
I see.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
I agree.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Certainly, Ben.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Then you really are a gardener?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
... My suitcase.
Does it have a television?
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. That is surprising.
No. I don't object.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I live here.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
No.
No, I do not have any of those.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Yes, I will.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
... Yeah...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
That could be possible...
Thank you, Colonel.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
It's that serious, huh?
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Tell your friends.
Morning.
Is the trial date set?
Hi.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
Tell her you need to see her.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
So how was it?
No. I understand perfectly.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'm right?
You married?
That's the usual?
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sure. It'd be fun.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Lotte, this is so good...
Let him try.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
A scary dream?
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
No you mustn't, my child.
No.
When?
Yeah, I saw them
What's the play?
No.
How'd you get this number?
Can I get you a drink?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Captain Mertin?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You still know.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
Baby, don't be like that.
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
Don't pay to complain.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Can't locate him.
He ask, I give him anything.
You was friends.
What run him off? Tell me that!
I run him off.
That's so.
All he can. All he can.
Yeah. Look bad?
You got to get up from here, girl.
What, baby?
She left me. She's gone again.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
What do you think?
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Uh-huh.
The Gundersons.
Jesus fucking Christ.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
That is for the urn.
Fuckin' A.
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
I am the Walrus.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
It's already posted.
Are you gonna split hairs?
No--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Please, feel free to inspect them.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
I like your style, Dude.
Which one was Logjammin'?
I thought you might know, man.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
"Johnson"?
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Well...yeah--
Oh?
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
So...that doctor.
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
Am I wrong!
Theodore Herzel.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Hey Walter--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Huh?
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Walter, you fuck!
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
No Dude.
There weren't any shots.
Then what's...
Walter Sobchak.
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Mind if I smoke a jay?
WHAT?!
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Well?  Aren't you?
I said out.  Now.
Why?
how long since he was bitten?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Anyone else make it?
How does it look?
Your security's for shit, kid.
What's your problem, Whistler?
And why is that?
So you're going to do this?
He was here.  Watching us.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
How can you be out here?
Maybe I don't see it that way.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
You used me as bait?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
There is no cure.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
You're hurt --
Is he sick?
Some. It's been slow --
It won't work on you.
-- tearing me -- apart.
I know. Take some of my blood.
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I don't believe that.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
What happens then?
Who are you people?
We keep in radio contact.
Why do you hunt them?
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
What happened to the power?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Yes.
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
Mrs. Leavitt--
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
What?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
--or someone--
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Nothing. I dunno--
Just...try and go back to sleep.
You have to go.
Beer and weed is what I've got.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
There, what? I didn't see anything.
That's what Josh and Mike said.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
We should be so lucky.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Too busy eating us?
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
How's she going to know where to--
For "James?"
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--who?
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Asleep--
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Why?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Pointless.
What's that?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
What'd you see?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Are you alright?
What?
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Get some more beer.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Spare me.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Who <u>is</u> this??
Yes.
I could've sworn I heard something.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
Thanks.
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
We don't seem to be communicating--
I own the place.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...There's a big--
Yeah. Is it...
Red Label.
What.
Thanks Meurice.
Got a problem, Meurice?
What?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
It must be great.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
. mommy's here.
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Can I feel 'em?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
THEN WHAT?
No. Come on.
No.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright. 
Yes.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Don't say that.
Hi. can I come in?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
No.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I sure don't hate you.
Do you like my body?
You like to open me. don't you?
Frank would open you.
Beeeee careful.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I want you to stay with me.
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Oh yeah?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
What did you see?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
Did you see her undressed?
I'm really sorry.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
I can't dance fast.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy Vallens?
No Jeffrey!!
Hi Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
God. you scared me.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Motherfucker works fast.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
I see.  How much?
We want some grass.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Not really, no.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Murder.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
How are we doing?
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Are you comfortable with this?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
In how long?  A week?
Yeah, layaway.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
It would be my pleasure.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yeah, maybe.
And Diego?
I know.
Not mad.
No.
George.
But this is...
Where are you going?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
I don't know.
I fucked up.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
You afraid of these ...?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
But I haven't shot him.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Why?
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
Take some time off.
An inquiry into what?
About three hours.
The official cause?
Like cats and dogs.
No questions.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Aren't they all?
That's ridiculous.
A little after eleven.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
How did he look?
Who found him?
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
About a year and half ago.
Can you give the court an example?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What happened after that?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Did he make your life miserable?
What happened next?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
What do you have in your purse?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Yes.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Yes -- she did.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Alone?
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
You killed him -- didn't you?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
-- But it's Sunday.
But Your Honor--
I can back it up.
I am relaxing.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
I'm not.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I don't know.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Well, there's a problem.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
I never knew that.
Oh, yes.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Roseman Bridge?
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
She starts sniffing me.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Why, do you think?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Francesca?
What?
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I would love to come for dinner.
How about Italy?
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
But you don't mind.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
No one's asking you to!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
Then he can move! People move!
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
But now that you have it -
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
'Bout 4:30.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
What's her name?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Just some flies.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
That's what?
Wh-wh-whooo?
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Those 'fools' are my people.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I have to finish this for class.
And what's that?
All the more reason I should be here.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
You were just a kid.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You haven't?
Admit what?
I think you're fucking crazy!
The money!
Caesar!
Caesar, what happened?
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
But you know he did it.
No.
...  maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What?
It's not here, Caesar.
Shut up, Violet.
You murdered Gino!
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
Okay, sure, Mick.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Hello?
Yeah.
Truck.
'63 Chevy.
I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Okay, one drink.
What do you want?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
He's a launderer?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
What's wrong?
I don't understand - ?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What was it then?
What about that guy this morning?
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
How much money?
Yeah, twice.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Where will you be?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
What if he doesn't run?
I'm still here.
I don't know what we're talking about.
That's all I get?
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Right.
Sir, you waited on line.
Yes.
Was it the break-in?
I need a ride.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
What if I say no?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Listen to what you want.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
-- we'll explain it --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
Who is it?
xxxxxx
And that's it?
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
Can I help you?
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- I'm on it --
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
...ergency procedures.
You telephone, sir.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Sam!
Long time no see!
You sound worried.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
What is it?
Am I?
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Er ... no.
Very smart.
Yes. I'm impressed.
Why?
They weren't at school with us.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
It does doesn't it?
Suit me?
Well, terrorists of course.
Security.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Get away!
Let go! We've got to stop!
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
What happened to you after ...
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Oh, good!
Would you really, Sam?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
That's it.
What! Shit!
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
A woman eh? I see.
You haven't switched it on.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
This isn't rare!
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Uh ...
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
This is an emergency!
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
No need, sir
I don't know which numero.
what? ... Oh ... 
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
In that time, you ever have sex?
Frank Pierce.
Is this what you gave Mary?
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
No, I'd better not.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Our Lady of Misery.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Five years.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Who's that?
It's coming.  Hold her down.
That's too many.
He got better.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
You can't believe how much he's improved.
I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
How's he doing?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
You're in the stomach!
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
No?
What did they do with you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Okay.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
A half hour in the lobby.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Okay.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
What is she shooting?
Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Almost immediately.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Jane?
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Should I...
Yes.  That's right.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
No.  Not even you.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
If we could just eat first.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
They said it would be okay if...
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Billion.
What do you mean clean?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Jane?
I didn't think you'd make it.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
Uh-huh.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
You're saying stay away from him.
That's enough.  That's enough.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
What the hell's going on?
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
You think I'm creative?
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
No! I want to talk about it now!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
There's that weird dude again.
People seem to like my cat.
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
Yeah, why?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Police officer.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Smack?
Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
Maxwell.
Hi.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
No, we didn't.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Yeah, I guess.
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Something like that.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
You left me a message?
You're even weaker than the others.
I'll back that up.
Yeah?
I didn't expect to see you.
Thanks.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
Dress, huh?  What for?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Am I in trouble or something?
In Virginia.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Not a pressing issue.
Uh... gym.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
All right.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I was just scared is all.
I don't get it.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Hi, Grueller.
Write that down.
Oh, baby!
Okay, let's go.
And Spring Fling.
Wit-tay.
Oh, God.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I am.
Yeah maybe you're right.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Death is like spring training?
No.
You can't seduce me.
That's my leg.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Damn.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
No.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
Where's Ebby?
Ain't he warning up?
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
What the hell's going on out there?
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Where does he go?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Look at yours.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
Oh, good.
Hey!
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
When did this happen, honey?
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
No, no it's okay.
I'll be honest with you.
Yes, you lost your control.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Please...
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
What - what, Caesar's?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
You never - ?
What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
We need this guy.
This woman's an institution.
Okay. Just take it easy.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
You all right?
You sure?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
You didn't have to beat him up!
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
...the rest of the two million is still there?
You're not takin' Amy.
To the Riviera.
She had the same.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You are not threatening me anymore!
It won't happen again, Sam.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
No, Sir.
Yeah.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I don't want to go to Europe.
What expenses?
You gotta go back out there.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yes.
Can I go in?
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Now move along.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
It's instinctive, you know.
Carmine left?
He's not here?
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
How are you?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Mm-hm.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
Well, how 'bout that?
Okay?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
He was just on the phone.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Are they out now?
Hey, how you doin'? 
Two.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
It's up to you.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah.
Fuck you!
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Well, I'm a little confused here.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
That's enough.
All right, all right. But I - I -
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Enough.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
What did--?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You are...
You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
You switched license plates?
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Will you let me explain!
I don't believe you.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Don't lay this on me!
Please.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
What do you do for a living?
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
What did you do?
God, if he doesn't come back --
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Can you walk?
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Who's in back?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
I'm still okay.
Naturally.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Got a phone in that van?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
We don't see you.
Just relax.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
You should've done all this before.
Stop the crying.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Who am I talking to?
Call me "Nels."
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
I can see the benefit in that.
Where's the backpack?
Who were you talking to?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Who are you?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
She's not a girl, Col --
See that, Col?
He's still looking, Col.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
You on the game?
No, I didn't --
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Where?
What's that about?
Shouldn't I go?
Yes...
You mean that?
Give it over, Dil --
Must be.
Do you care, Jimmy?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Know what, honey?
Am I becoming repetitious?
Should have stayed a girl.
So I got it wrong, then.
She own you, Jimmy?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
So it's true, then?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm going home!
Good-bye, Dil
You tried.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Yes.
What would you do for me?
Never.
Promise?
I promise.
Have a look at him.
He's all right.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
I know.
And what if you don't?
You may be right.
I take pride in my work.
Give him a cup of tea.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Thanks.
What?
Right.
Fuck you.
Eat something, would you?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
Absolutely not.
Don't I know it.
How different?
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Is it bad?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I told you not to talk that way --
How can I?
The fastest.
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Don't run off, Jude.
Not here.
I never know nothing.
I said shut the fuck up --
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Oh, come on!
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
When you come on, you really come on.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
Me? Why me?
Yes -- ?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Do I knock or something?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Sure.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Okay.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
What -- like Scobie?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
What do you mean, no?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
You loved him?
He didn't have one.
About how wealthy would you say?
I found it! I found it!
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Yes.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
Charles is.
What are you doing here?
How did you find out?
Where did everything go?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
We'll find you a hotel.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
What was all that?
You mean you and me?
We're here.
Where?
On the street where you live.
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Go on.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Yes -- that's right.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
How do you know what they're doing?
Words can hurt very much.
Yes?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
Because I don't love him.
I've never seen him before.
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Not my imports.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
She's my daughter, Tom.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
You are upset.
Are you sure?
You were eavesdropping.
You found her?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Can you get inside?
You're not?
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
I was desperate. It was gross.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
What?
What?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
Yeah.
What?
What?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
Okay, okay.
At least somebody likes this shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

Shit!
...-ty.
No argument there.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
You want cash?
Go on.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
 

I was thankin' you, asshole!
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Well, then, that means it's call...
Oh, shit.
...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
I don't think we have much of a choice...

Come on, old Pete.
 Oh...
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Come on...
Ho, ho...
 Go, go.


Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
These'll keep it cold.
...yeah.
...man!
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
You know what I'm sayin'?
We were nationally  ranked.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
...shit.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...shit.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
That is loud!  I'm 
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Ow!  
Yeah.
Okay. 
Sometimes the prey bites back.
...on!
Whoo!
Mason.
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!

What'd you come back for?!

 Well.
Who drove the ice cream...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
You, Arlo.
Us.  Owes us.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
No.
Yeah.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.

Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

This country trained me to kill...
Well, well, well.
...here.   Mason... 

All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Exactly.
...including the permanently extreme.
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Is it--?
...to be off the island tonight.
Now listen to me.
You'll kill us all!
You look good, Richard.
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...-ple.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Almost quaint.
...happen if I drop this?
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
It's clean.
...quick in and out.
...-ther orders?
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
Richard Long.
...-fall.
Where's their protective...
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...time to time, yeah.
...should be right outside.
I don't see my container.
You try anything, it goes in...
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...

Goddamn it, Ma-...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
Kabula's out.
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
...-son.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
My secret?
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...and that power...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Call an ambulance.
The compound has to be kept cold...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Yeah, I just....
Where are you now...
...to talk, son.
...hands!
...on the other end of this phone.
...side!
The usual.  Doc.
Gimme this god-...

 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
An honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Always?
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Avocado groves?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
What are you talking about?
Well you own a lot of land.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
Hello, Jake.
Oh yes.
I'd like to talk to him.
No.
No?
What are you doing here?
How do you happen to know her?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
It's too late.
Matter of fact I do.
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
Yeah.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
My husband's at the office.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
How did you find out?
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Why?
Unless what?
No, not for that one.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
What? What is it?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Why?
It was in Chinatown.
Hold still. Why?
...No. Why was it.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
But, Mr. Gittes.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
The obituary column?
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
Yeah.
...Yes of course.
Then go home and forget about it.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
He's not in, Mr.?
Yes.
They were partners.
What's that, pal?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
So I can have these? 
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Thanks for all you've done for me.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
My husband...you know him.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else you been to see?
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
What's happened?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
But, Mr. Kane -
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
A rooster?
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
I won't let you go.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
Thanks.
Impossible!  Impossible!
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Close the door, Raymond.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
What's wrong, Brad?
Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Rawlston is my boss.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Was he in love?
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Well, thanks a lot.
How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Are you sure?
Am I sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
You're shittin' me.
It's not the same.
Thanks. Have a good one.
I think you'd better leave now.
That's it, everybody out.
Yeah, but not in here.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Can I use the bathroom?
Such a sordid state of affair.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
He was?
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You lie.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
But can we date?
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
What about Sing?
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Are you open?
I can pass!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
You open?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You only brought one ball?!
Shit!
You're late.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That girl was vile to you.
I think it's safe to say yes.
All four?
You know what I just watched?
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
What's that?
The Emperor.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
No.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Vermont?
Are you gonna lock the store?
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Oh, my god.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
I'm going with you.
An embarrassing way to die.
Reach what?
What, your dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Her fucking body fell out!
Let me borrow your car.
I want to rent a movie.
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
Living proof.
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
You didn't have to choke me.
Thanks.
You still didn't have to choke me.
All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...
He's got those love handles.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
What's that mean?
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
Veronica.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Ooh! Can we?!
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Twelve.
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
All right. Name it.
Why do you call him that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
What is it?
What did he say?
Thank you for the lasagne.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
What time do you get finished?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
I don't want to go back with her...
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
No way.
I think the lady called it.
That's tight. Solid.
Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Dental School.
Like hell you are!
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Hal's signalling he's OK.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
A monkey?
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I did what I thought was right.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Two...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
Did I miss something?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
What about you?
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
What's he doing?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
On top of the peak.
Where's the rest of the team?
I don't know about totally.
What the hell are you doing--
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Don't use my name!
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Good evening.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Who are they, sir?
You've not been to school all week, son.
Alex.
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Who said that?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Surprise?
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
I wanna be sick.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Crime?
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
C of E, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
Lice?
Through there for a bath.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Fine... fine.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I just say what the other person would say?
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
What?
But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Bottega.
But not now?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Jesus...
How do I know you'll keep your word?
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
What thing?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
It's nothing.
I'm in town for a short time.
I've been calling and calling.
What's he sayin'?
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
You on some kind of work plan?
No.  You say you're cool.
What?
Try some deep breathing.
What are you doing?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
Who was he?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Another collateral.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Yeah?  What happened?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
I don't know.
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Head towards Union Station.
One more.
You're full of shit.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
What'd they do?
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Answer the question.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I never told her.
Are you crazy?!
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
You think I'm crazy.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Just relax.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Arf... You gotta help me.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
What is it with you and the space program?
Can you prove any of this?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Shoot.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
He's why you punish yourself.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Murdered?
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Jerry, I --
Now what?
Connecticut.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
How'd you get the picture?
How did you know?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Which way did he go?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
You mean --
Actually I'm running late --
I don't understand.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Could we hear to China?
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Now... you go home.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
Peter Valerian.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
Any luck on the grant money?
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
Actually --
Ellie --
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
What...?
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
Meaning...
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
But --
Buck is a deal.
No.
Yeah.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
Pair'a nines.
Well, whatta we got here?
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
We got it locked in the sock.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
But, Luke...
On my own.
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
I'm in.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
No. No chains either.
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
When are you going to call them?
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
You get me out first.
Where is it?
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Because of your phone calls.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Is it an ongoing case?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Ruben.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
What's that siren?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
The lock...
Open the door.  Please.
Just get out of your vehicle...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Honest to God, Ruben!
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
There was no sperm.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
We could use a little help.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
We were together six years, sir!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
Not a lot of action here.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Are we allowed to park here?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Hard to say.
Crash victim?
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Tomorrow?
Which flowers did you order?
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
I'm only looking out for you.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
I answered these questions last night.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
A small price.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Don't be ridiculous.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
Tell the doctor.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Tell me all.
I better make a list.
It's TV heaven.
Do you like it?
I love your apartment.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
I think I should go home.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I sure know what that feels like.
What are we going to do?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
Are you all right?
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
So will you?
I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Oh.
What?
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
What?
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
I'm not here to negotiate.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Bring me the scissors.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
All right, knock it off.
Does it really matter what I say?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Why haven't you turned us in?
How much?
It's me.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Yeah, French guys from France.
What'd they take?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I see.   A master criminal.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Me?
You guys used to work together?
They sort of got away.
Anybody know about that car outside?
How are we going to do that?
I think we went the wrong way.
Holy shit.
How do we know what room she's in?
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Who are you waiting for?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
What's this?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
You're already a thief.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Hello.  What is your name?
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
No, really?
Where is he now?
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
What do you want?
Never!
Give it back!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Don't send me back!
Go.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
What do you have in mind?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
You don't say.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
Fun -- look at that guy...
It's just the dope, don't worry
Mister Funboy lives there?
No.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
I don't know you.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Don't waste my time.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Who got himself what?
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Thank you.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
You talking to me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Romantic? He rapes her.
How's the water?
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
That's repulsive.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
How about tonight?
That's also none of your business.
What?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I do not.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
I just came to say goodbye.
I think that's for the best.
Please don't go.
Why aren't you understanding?
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
That's great.
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
Do you want to learn or not?
It was nothing.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
If that's what you call it.
What do I do then?
Excellent.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
My mom? Don't call my mom.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
And you think she bought it?
She bought it.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Why not?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Fuck her yet?
You amaze me.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Oh come on. For her first time?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Ronald?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
You're too kind.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
She's not here.
I did?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
But where did you get it, Amy?
On the back street  a green house
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I know that.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I think I should.  3000W?
Did you hear the child out?
I haven't had my breakfast.
I thought you were with Amy.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Yes, daddy.
But wishes don't come true.
It's true.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Daddy, it's true.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
I'm your friend.
Will you be friend for always?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
It stands so still.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Look at my ring.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
I like stories.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Hurry, hurry.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
There was a sale.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Does she have PMS?
Jennifer?
Maybe he's just shy.
Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
And then?
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
What the hell is the tampon test?
How'd it go with the cop?
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
I think he called you beautiful.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Why not? There's been a murder.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
About Mark? Carlton?
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
I'm not really hungry after all.
So pee? Here?
My bra is my biggest supporter.
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
What's that supposed to mean?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
What's with the squirt guns?
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You want her sheets?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Just visiting my patient.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please, they'll kill me...
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
You wont regret this, sir.
It seems fine.
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
I don't know who they are.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
What does she say?  The woman.
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I have to go...
No, it's the truth.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
... what?
Fine?
Don't call the Vice President!
TilT we figure something out.
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Clean.
What about the wife?
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
You ever think back to how you started.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.
You're kidding.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
I don't mind.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I can't.
I missed...
Please....shoot me.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Datura.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
Aaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily sorry...for having offended Thee....offended Thee...
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
Oh, I have no doubt.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
No, sir.
What'dya get?
Tricks...Jesus...
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
It will?  How do you figure?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
At Chet Danburry's house.
What do you mean you don't know?
I told you, that's a secret.
I think he's sweet.
What?
Don't stop.
Sure.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Where'd you find them?
What are you doing?!
You fucked up little prick!
But I love you.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Meeks.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
I'm sorry, Neil.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
What is it then?
And now he will?
Come on, that's impossible.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
I will be with thee straight.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
We were talking about my schedule...
Hanover, listen...
I don't know where it is!
Finnegan...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
...Jagger was here...I was here...
What did you do the my kids!!
It's okay...come on...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
What the hell does that mean?
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked me too.
John,we're going huntin'.
What the --!
It's Nick!
Couple of weeks... Listen --
He's real bad, Nick.
Sure. Why not.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Oh. Fine.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Where's it gone?
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Will you marry me?
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
I don't know.
I know.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah... I guess.
You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
You think we'll ever come back?
Promise! You gotta promise!
I'm doing that too.
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
More bullets in the gun?
Three bullets -- minimum.
How's Linda?
You wanna bet?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
Cynthia! Sure.
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
No.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
The faster you get Doucet, the younger you'll be.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Yes, sir.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Wanna try?
I'm here.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Who are these people?
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
What Grange?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
No, you're not.
-- of what happens after we die!
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
You know darn well it is.
Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Oh, Jabez.
Not all of it?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
I'll get the doctor.
There is nothing to worry about now.
I'll get it, Jabez.
I'll never get my washing done.
I'm serious.
Isn't that your own fault?
But Jabez, I never said that!
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Do you really think that?
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
But meant her moving here.
You're all right, Argyle.
What's happening?
Ellis, what have you told them?
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
Nothing...
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Hans.  Your Hans.
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
How do you know?
Yessir.
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
Gene -- you smilin'?
Yes, I would.
You'll be okay.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
How are you doing?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah... I know.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
I'm sorry...
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Yeah.
Look... who's on the phone?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... yeah!
It's my only chance!
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
They're okay.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Come on.  I want you to see something.
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
What else?
We're all set at Kennedy.
The gun's right on your back...
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
We like you, too.
Would I hire you?
What is it, Sam?
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
My body?  What for?
He's gone?
... The bodies out the door.
What kind of a deal?

We'd kill ourselves.
Yeah ...
What'd he say?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
I want them all.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
What can he do, he's clean...
I am.
I forgot she's in here.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
You could give up.
<i>I forgot.</i>
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
I don't know.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Stop it.
Cunt.
I said stop it.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
How you be?
I be.  I'm living large.
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I'm gonna leave now.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
How long?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
You're a drunk fool.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Ten.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
He's just being nice.
He's completely innocent.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
And move to Long Island...
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Depends.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
You keep it.
OK.  OK.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
I can't be staying long anyway.
You a blue-moon fool.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Why you gotta curse?
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
Later.
Smack him back.
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
That's the dope.
You really think so?
Pino, relax, will ya.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
Ooh gross.
HARRY? Are you okay?
What?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Is that what I think it is?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
You're not my real dad.
No.
I didn't know that.
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
You can't marry my mom.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
A raft.
George Washington!
You're it.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
But my mom gave me the map.
I... found that rock.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
TURK, leave him alone.
You're just jealous.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Yes, what?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
That's my boyfriend.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Who's there?
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
So what do you keep in there?
My Lord!
He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
So, this is Leto the Just...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
He knows.
Man-carved steps.
Will we see a worm?
Always.
What's in the box?
SILENCE... SILENCE.
Did they try and fail?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Don't you bave a car?
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
I never thought of that.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Bela, are you ready?
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Last night was quite a romp.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
I don't know.  Where?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
What do you think you're doin'?!
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I'm no good.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
Tor!
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Are you a fruit?
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
OUR picture?
There's still a sex-change --
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
Huh?
Who's Dr. Tom?
I can't get it to go up.
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Why... yes.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
Isn't that the same thing?
What if--you're vomiting?
No! Do they show you having sex?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
You thought it was me?
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You're nuts.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You think she really likes him?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
Take him off the air.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No. It's a mess.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Oh my God!
Both.
It was horrible. He called me up.
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Right, yeah --
What is she, at work?
Are you asking me?
How much less?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
That's lucky.
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
I need to talk.
Kinda'.
Where were you?
I got your message. Way to go!
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
You brought the cameras here!
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
Me?! That's you!
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
I was in jail.
Hi.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Mr. M.?
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
Well, good luck there, Tracy
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
So what brings you here?
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Yes?
What's this?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Door was open.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
More this way.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Shall we give it a name?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Hey Yeah?
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Okay, let's say
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
And 290 "disregards," right?
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
I'm not like you.
So?
Who put you up to this?
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Hell, good luck!
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
What'd I do?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Did they deserve it today?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
What work?
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
That's him.  That's him.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
She's fine.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Susan Lefferts.
Clean?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
Dudley, we've been over this.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
<u>No</u>.
What's this all about, lad?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I need to speak to you.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
You make a mistake?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.
Not good enough.
I'm curious about you.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
How about White?
I'll take your word for it.
Right now, before I back down.
Under the house.
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Sid, how are they hanging?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
What'd he say to you?
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Listen--
It is?
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yeah.
I don't know what that--
What do you mean?
What'd I tell you?
That is one ugly sunrise.
The NSA killed him.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Those are Feds.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
These guys are incredibly persistent.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
I'll be right back.
Your stuff?
For your wife?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
What do you mean?
Bobby?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
I know.
Is Eric in school?
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Other than me.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
How can I be sure.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That's temporary.
How?
I've never met him?
I <u>did</u> care how.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
You're a moron, you know that?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Robert--
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Sure, go ahead.
Table 122?
Bobby--
Bobby--
Calm down.
They killed Rachel.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
They're framing me.
Listen to me.
Yeah.
Well we'd sure like to help you.
You would?
We'd have to--
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
So they know everything.
We don't know.
What about the tape?
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Excuse me?
I don't want to go back.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
I do not.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Dance with me.
Don't talk.
Could I trouble you for some water?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Count Laszlo de Almsy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Why do they care about our maps?
When's Clifton picking you up?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
David Caravaggio.
No.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Are you Hana?
So was my Patient.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I think that's called looting.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Are you planning to be the exception?
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I see.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
How?  How can you see anything?
Yes?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
Arguing about books.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
Hello.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
I was looking forward to this evening.
Yessir.
Why?  Are you German?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
So he popped the pane?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
I'm in the middle.
Too late now.
No you can't.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
I've got something for you.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
It's one way.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I trust it's your size.
You were afraid of heights?
Aren't we all.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Oh, I don't care about the money.
That's because you grew up rich.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Hang on.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
This is big enough.
Because I never assume anything.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
It's too soon.
Remind me why.
We're supposed to.
You damn well thought wrong.
She's calling the shots now.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
See you.
Probably not.
250,000?
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Whoa.  Remind me.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
They did?
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Oh, my God.
Yup.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
You're a girl.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
And you can't?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
That's crazy -- why not?
You wanna talk about --
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
And if you had to guess ...
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Erin?  What are you --
What is that?
When'd they file the demur?
Who's the judge?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
It happens all the time.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
We'll see.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Whose number do you need?
Why not?
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
Great.
I'm just saying --
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Nothing.
I can't leave my job, George.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
What?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Next week.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
I can help them!
I feel The Force.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... Like we're being watched.
Give me that!
Yes sir!
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
The temperature is dropping too fast.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
We?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
What was it?
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Stop that.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Where?
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
I was worried about you.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Repairs ...
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Thanks.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Someone's falling.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
What's in there?
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
His reactor's starting to overheat.
I tried...
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
See you in hell, Snake.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Location.
Me too?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
No screamin' shit.
You need help.
What the hell is this?
What are you gonna do in Venice?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Of Merlin?
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Yes.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Who is, then?
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
And you cannot love me...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
It is.
The oath. You didn't say--
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What is it?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Rats?
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
A stimulant.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
So, what causes this?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
I beg your pardon?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
But how?
Like what?
What else?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Please.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
You've been playing with it?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
Oh I bet he is.
I wouldn't talk.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Well I heard differently.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
St. Mike's.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Damien Karras.
You just missed them.
Sure.
What's playing.
Who's in it?
You'd like that?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Do it again.
What's that?
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Can you give her something?
I've seen him.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Really?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
I've seen it.
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Miss?
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes.
I don't know.
So?
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
Piano.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Huh?
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
No thanks.
I made her nervous.
The hell you don't.
It wasn't like that.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
I'm not unhappy.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
See anything?
You recognized me.
I thought we had separate rooms.
Unless you want the right.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
Really.
No. Why?
You saw wrong.
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
What're you doing?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
What?
Looks like these got a few years on them.
How're your hands?
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
So what'd you think?
I guess you're,right.  Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
Sick?  How sick?
Uh... he knows it.
Miss --
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
Where's my name?
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
I don't believe it.
Hey, we're connected.
Great?
Hey, will you look at that?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Huh?
Yes, well, they are.
How come?
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
Don't worry about it.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
It went well tonight.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
It's okay.  Last one.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
How do you do it? Every night?
What's the matter?
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
So ... ?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Yeah.
Oh?
Older than me.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
How old is he?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
It's important.
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
What -- what are you doing?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
What's that?
What do you know about it?
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
The hospital.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
What is with you tonight?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Oh, that Karl.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Adelle?
No.
Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Big Eds.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Got a minute, Jack?
Cmon Jack...
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
How much time?!
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Are you okay?
What kind of man does that!?
Jack...dont even start...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
What are you doing?
Jack...
Here you go...
Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining.
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
Youre so...beautiful...
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Kate...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Not by a long shot.
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
Okay, Ill take them...
Damn...damn...damn...
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
How'd you know it was me?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Are you alright?
What the --!
You got a chisel round here?
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Ben --
'Course not.  Strictly business.
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
Back it down, Johnny!
I though we went over this.
Apparently I can disappear.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Ben's still out there --
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Oh, I think you already have.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
I'd hold that off awhile.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
You mean <I'm> going along?
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Listen...the Heart.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
That could be quite a lethal weapon... It could kill, not cure.
Look at that...they're changing color...
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
There it is!
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Uh -- what?
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
How's it look?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
I don't know. Few munce.
No.
Unguent.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Huh?
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
...Who's Jean?
Yah, but this TruCoat -
End a April.
I unnerstand.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
Yah.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, real good.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Okay.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah!
Good day, sir.
...Who they playin'?
I know it's a lot.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
Well, they -
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Yah?
Yah?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You don't think he's mixed up in -
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
Nope.
So?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
We've got a -
Three-cent stamp.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Hmm?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
What... ?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
I'm sorry, I...
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Who did this to you?
Oh, yeah.
... You know me?
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
No, supply oxygen?
What do you do, Tyler?
Thank you.
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
There's always that.
What list?
Well, I have to file a claim...
What?
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
Alive or dead?
Okay... Ghandi.
Unbelievable, huh?
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
You want to finish her off?
You get rid of her.
You quit?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
I asked you what you studied.
Something on your mind?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Look...
... is over.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
You have jobs.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...stop me?
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
What the fuck -- ?
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why what?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
Why?
I... I don't know...
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
Speed up.
Carter.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
What?
What was the fight about?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
I tried calling last night but your father --
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Stop it, don't move him!
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Can I ask you a question?
And you're gonna die after me, right?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
I'll remove him.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
You guys are real... aren't you?
No.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
What's this stuff on the rice?
What's that?
Roundeye.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Why'd they want us?
Invulnerable.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
John.  My name is John.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
What's the job?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
Christ almighty.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
Colonel.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
The moron?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
See, I told you!
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Where?  Maybe we can.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Which ones?
A list.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Where am I?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
The Little People?
Him...?
Parry... I'm Jack.
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Who are you talking to Jack?
What?
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Are you all right?
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Don't say that.
I never say anything I have to.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
What?
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
What?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Sure you don't want anything?
How far are you going to?
Hey, mack!
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
Who's Van Oost?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
I'm talking to you, Tita!
That's dangerous, you know.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
Why?
You had no inner feeling?
Wait...
What?
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I don't think that's true.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
That's an old maid's tale.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Yo.
Remember me, from the pool?
I, umm, came to see you.
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Eddie from Compost?
Why?
So what girls are over there?
Pitt.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Eddie from Compost?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
Yo! What you goin' for
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Like this?
Wha'?
You sure?
Your friend must be misinformed.
So what do you want with her anyway?
No.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Maybe tonight?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
Nineteen.
Fletch!
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I think Id rather have drugs.
You don't know me.
What, the heat here?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
Oh my God!
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
I guess not.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
And what was that?
Harry S. Truman?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Who?
Why don't you try suicide?
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Where am I going?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Will you kill me?
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
Did you say cops?
I'm sorry?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Hi.
I really should change.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
Good point.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
This morning.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Who?
How could you call him?
What?  Who the hell are they?
Who's Frieda?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
I said, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Oh... I have some questions.
Thanks for the promotion, man.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
'Booty Time.'
What's fine?
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
Well try, okay?
Man, I'm clean.
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Il fallait le faire.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
There's nobody like that on six.
Yeh?  Who else?
That's in France.
Strike out, eh?
When ya go back on?
Who is that guy?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
What about Sal?
I been damn careful up to now.
Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Butch called.
Okay...
I know.  He loves that thing.
No, I don't.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
You call your son Little Chief?
What?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I don't know.
I'm thirty-five years old.
No, not yet.
I think I'm losing you.
I lost you.
But that's tomorrow.
Tell me.
Are you alright"?
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
How?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
John.  John, you all right?
I better give you my address then.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
What?
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
So how'd you like LION KING?
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Who brought up this bright idea?
Why don't we go take a swim?
I don't know...
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
Barely.
I'm a slow eater.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
You promised you'd never ask me.
You know him?
In that little thing?
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Is that all you found?
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
But, Dad, we...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
So what are ya drawin'?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Eight times.
I know everything about you, Diana.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
What are you doing?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I didn't kill her!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
Have you seen Tamara?
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Christ...where's Rennie??
Jason's here in New York.
They're out of town.
Where did you get that alcohol?
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
What are you talking about?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
I can't swim.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
What about you?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
What did you find?
Don't talk like that.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
Do we care?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
You know about Adele.
She died.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
About what?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
All right. What's been going on?
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
I'm glad we're having this talk.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
People are dependable.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Pop, will you let me in?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Matthew's my grandson.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
Because life is good.
Don't worry. It's a test.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Postpone. We have every right.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Engaging.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
Would you like to meet him?
The fact is, I have to get going.
But you're his friend.
Where are you going now?
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Everyone takes his turn.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
I'm sorry.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
You've done me a great service.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
It's split the Government.
It's for the best.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
Twelve have a mission within the week.
Hello.
It's about the Director.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
They'll recognize me.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Will you be okay?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
In case you get back before I do.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.

Why not?
I've found him too.
Yes.
Why don't we say we were together?
They found an eyelash.
In the South Wing.
What exactly is wrong?
My medication.  I left it back there.
--when you go away.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I've got enough here.
What about them?
Hello, Doc.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
You go out much?
I couldn't have... much longer.
You know how I feel?
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Doc...
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I don't want to go there.
There better be a guy with the
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
When are you going to learn?
No more about Beynon.
Okay.
You okay?
Where do we go from here?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
No, I'm afraid not.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Where?
How about if I buy your car for ten grand?
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
Yeah.
I made a mistake.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Jack?
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Everyhing go off all right?
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Nicer than most.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
It is. Honestly.
Yes. I met him last year.
He was here for four days.
No. I didn't know that.
Who's setting you up in this place?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Not entirely. No.
You sure about that?
I don't know.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
Yeah.
You all right now?
At me friend's house.
That's what I was wondering.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
I see.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
They came back?
What's that supposed to mean?
No.
No. Are you tired?
Not much.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
They do that up North.
Three hundred altogether?
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
You did?
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
All of, they got you on this "board..."
And it's not right to the customers.
Shoes, boots, yes...
For some sales pro...
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
I heard that they were running cold.
That's what I...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
As a robbery.
You're going to steal the leads?
Is that what I said?
What?
Me?
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
It is dead.
That's...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
They stole the phones.
He said we...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
Yes.
No.
You think so?
You understand?
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Mmm.
Who told you...?
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
...no...
...you talk to Murray...
Yes.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
And fifty bucks a lead.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
What are you trying to tell me?
What?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
You did that?
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
You sold eight Mountain View?
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
From the store.
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
Harriett...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Glad to meet you.
My wife told me to look into...
Uh...
Kenilworth...?
Rick...?
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Yes.
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
I've got to talk to you...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
The check wasn't cashed?
I'm...
I...
She told me not to talk to you.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
Have a good trip.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
You did?
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
I have the stuff from last year's...
...Mr. Williamson...
Did you see my present for you?
Just a few days.
Why do you have to go?
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
I'm not hungry.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
What took so long?
 You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
How are the kids?
Connie.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
If you need anything, just...
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Where's my brother?
I asked about Fredo?
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
It might show.
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
You're right.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Do you gamble?
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
You would have killed his brother?
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Who's asking?
Right here.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
Yes.
The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.
We do favors for each other...
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
Not good.
Let him gamble.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
We worked it all out beforehand.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Just thinking out loud.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
It still hurt.  A lot.
What're you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
I'm not married.
You did not know?
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
What's to sketch?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
Is this David's doing?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Does that surprise you?
I'm not, you know.
So we understand each other?
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You were a soldier?
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Who's that?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
So it is going to happen after all.
You are much too human.
I don't know.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Where's Betty?
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
What are you doing here?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
Of course.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
No.  I expect you can't.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
You know my back -
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
A little family emergency --
Double-meaning intended, right?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
No. That was Higgins ....
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
There's no one left ...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
You getting my checks ... ?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
We'll take it...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Kip -- ?
You okay -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
About what?
What happened to you?
You can handle it?
What are you doing here?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
What are you doing here?
He give you an advance -- ?
What's with the look?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
What the hell's that -- ?
You're going high-cheese, dude --
I do ... I cut "em...
Now... I'm in ...
What about The Club ... ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Hello, Otto ...
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
How come ... ?
You know what you got here?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
What do you do?
I'm gonna need some money.
With what?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
I better call again.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
How?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Done.
You know what to do?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Stay there.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
I don't want them left back.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You want a partner?
Yeah.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Oh shit.
What are we gonna do up there?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Who'd you call?
What?
All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
I told you, I just got change.
Chuck, let's go.
I'm not sure--
Will you take a check?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
What is it?
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Yeah, can I help you?
Okay. How?
Shall we start the, uh...
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I've been busy.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
You're here quite a bit, then.
I do.
Hold on!
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
About thirty million to one.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
What?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Yeah, I read those.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Yes, I do.
How'd it go?
I don't know.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
My wife's dead.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
You're kiddin' me.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
It's not...
That's what you want?
I'll keep in touch.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
How the hell did you do that?
No.
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Exactly.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Fine.
No.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Like me?
Do you play the piano?
No.
How 'bout you?
But ain't no reason--
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Got a warrant?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
And you ain't ashamed?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
They're all gone--or dead.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You people got a lotta nerve.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Where you going?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Sure. Good-by.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
They gone.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
But what about this?
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
What's these?
Now you done it! You busted it!
--Stop it--
What's your business?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Where have I been?
Are you going to the reunion?
Bad people.
Are you there?
Yes.
Hello...?
You look beautiful.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
I was leaving.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
What else? Say more.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
If he does our job, he's our job.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
They're not happy, sir.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They blame you for the compromise.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Shit.
Thanks.
Why didn't it work out?
Everything under control?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
Why? There's no food in the house?
Well, one was for salad...
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Nothing.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
David?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Aw... that's so sweet.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
What if she doesn't want to go?
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
May I have a suggestion?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
She calls him Tommy...
I'd love to go there one time...
They fired you?
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Promise?
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Mixed salad.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Tom?
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I wouldn't let happen.
She gonna be long?
I don't know if I can.
What does that mean?
What, sweetheart?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
Don't be such a baby!
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
What do you mean?
Cool?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
Ta-da!
Damn!
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
I want it to have my children!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
Blow me.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
What the hell is going on?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Are you challenging me?
Make it our first date.
And you have to smile.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Thank you.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Any questions?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Excuse me?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
We need to talk.
Okay sure. What about?
What?
I don't know Brady.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
What's going on?
Michael Myers.
Brady!
Go!
Its too late.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Four plus Myers.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Rachel come on.
Dad, what's going on?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Hell of a night.
You look sharp. You understand?
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Oh Christ. Doc...
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
It's over.
I know that Mr. Sayer.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
You're going to be late!
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
He was watching me.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
I wonder where they went.
Yeah.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
I found the car! He's here!
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
I promise.
What is it, Laurie?
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Hello.
Of course not.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
If you say so.
Pull up to the entrance!
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
What?
But I'm seeing him.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
I can't resist.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
And it ruins everything else.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
We could...we could do that.
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Hi, Dusty.
Could you--
Like, uh...?
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You're out looking here?
Oh, God.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
No, I don't think so.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Isn't that beautiful?
Elliot!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Not because of me, I hope.
I can't say anything!
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
This is not an easy situation.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
And you're in love overnight?
Great idea.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
I want one with you.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
I am... I did slave all day.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
So?
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
N-n-no, not that.
But not you.
It was on your shirt!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
How is everything?
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Oh!
Yeah.
True.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Yeah.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Really?
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Oh, gosh.
Yeah, that's clerical.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
You treat me like a loser.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Can we, can we go?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yeah.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Well, I hope you've changed.
So how are you?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Right.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Okay.
Just a few minutes ago.
Tch.
...you don't have to think.
...<u>please</u>...
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
I have not read you your rights.
I hereby acknowledge that...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
It wasn't my day.
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
Orderly.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
We could skip the Gavotte.
Say it in English.
...they did it for a lark.
Evelda Drumgo.
Then I'm doing fine.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Why did he come back?
Where was the call from.
...sir...?
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Now, why in the world would he do that?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
And how would you know that?
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
That could be.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
My husband brought it to me from America.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Why did you look at me that way?
How could you know?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
She my foster.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Indeed we were.
And how did he do that?
What's that, Baby?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Fine, thank you, but
....because we don't have any mmm...
...what did you want? 
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
...I feel that...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Yes.
I don't understand.
What is your point?
I..
When?
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
No, they're not from Wendy.
That would be a No.
What are you doing?
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Because you're an idiot.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Don't talk to me like that.
No.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Oh.
Perrier water!
Did to.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
I thought I...you..
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have to let me go!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
Look, Mother!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Yes . . .
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
The way you just looked at me...
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Uh... eighty two?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Poor Trevor.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Last week...
It's not that kind of date.
You okay?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
It's November.
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
You were... very... inspiring.
"A little mistake"!
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
Ticket!  What's going on?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
How are they with kids?
So where are all your toys?
Where are these toys of yours?
Any particular brand?
Right.
No, no, no, no.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
A man scared me.
Mommy!
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
Stop knowing me so well.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Did you hear what he said?
How long does it have to be a new house?
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Did the cleaning woman come?
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
I think it's time I came home now.
Oh God.
Just reduced.
God, your sister's really hot.
What for, dickweed?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
Even cosier.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Lieutenant.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
Around.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
I'm leaving.
If it came down to it what would you do?
No.  What am I to do?
Well?
Can you really tell from doing that?
What do you think?
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Why do you stare at me like that?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Why not?
I've seen it.
And the other one -- he is like you?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
What are you doing?
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.
He knows better than that.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
You with the cops?
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Who else is here?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
I overheard him with the girl.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
No one's coming.
We can't carry him.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Where are they?
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
What's wrong with the radio?
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
It's mine.  Talley.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Special Agent Jones.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I think so.
He has lots of disks.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Your phony FBI assholes.
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Name a price.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
They fired a rocket at us.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
The police are very busy.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
We are better here.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Let's have dinner first.
Do something.
No.
So where is the lamb?
What's the matter?
I have a confession. When we met...
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
Tell me what it was.
No! Sit down now.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
What do we do with all these people?
There are soldiers.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
And what's Steven's status?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, for chrissake --
Where is it??
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
What's down there?
Prove it.
Oh, Jesus....
-- closed.
Why?
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
We can do it...
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
Where did it go?
You've got your own TV show?
Then what the hell are we doing here?
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Where is she?
-- wit...nesses --
First time for everything.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
Well, I don't.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
-- it wasn't me.
Rewind that.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Blackburn's dead.
-- hey! --
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Good-bye.
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
You didn't think much about that before.
...set up some more things.
Oh come on!
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
Should I...
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
You're bleeding.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
We don't know.
I think we should do it.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Maura.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
Wha .... ?
It was off the statue.  In the club.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Terri?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
Wow.  Thank you.
But you gave me a rose ...
What ... What ... ?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
You're apologizing?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Cameras?
You got about five minutes and change.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
We're going in from the ground floor.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
My life is not some deal.  I...
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
How long were you in?
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....
Where did you get this?
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
This is the worst night...
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
If you do anything to my friend...
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Something short.
The Hoopsucker!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Cigarette?
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Smitty.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...I'm sorry.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
What a beautiful thought.
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Now, Aim --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
I filed it yesterday.
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
This I know, Benny.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Say, that was a swell idea!
And Sid says you stole it!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
Yeah?
No, sir.
But --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Not that way! Through the door!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
I got gas, Bennie.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
She finds him.
...He's not noticing, Benny.
He don't look wise.
She's got other problems, of course...
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
At the Houmfort.
That's nonsense, Alma.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
I think you need some help.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
But you didn't have to come up here.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Where do you think you're going?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Can't I take it for you?
Why did you come in here?
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You want that?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Investigation of what?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
You want to go?
You crying?
Dinner in ten minutes.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Ready to go?
I'll drive you --
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Here.
Huh?
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
Good-night dad.
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
Thank you Janey.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
You okay?
Please don't.
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Do what?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Jesus, Jim!
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Who said so?
Yeah?
Where you going?
It's freezing.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Wow!
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Is this Charles?
One more shot?
Yes, sir.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
I had him!
I have to get back.
You did your homework, Officer.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
We already did.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Not really.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What?
That's right.
What happened at that signing?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
What do you want to talk about?
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
Your friend's all business.
What is it?
You heard me that time.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
She used some stupid code name.
Yes.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Your lips, they didn't move.
What are we?
I was waiting for you...
Then blame the one who made her...
You said there were none.
We can do that?
Are these not the answers you came for?
Yes... My God...
I can't save her.
I couldn't prevent it.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
So you felt it too!
He can protect us, Claudia.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
What do you mean?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
You've just done it -
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
Fascination...
Why do you do this Lestat?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
That's all past, Lestat.
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
Yes.
What about coffins?
How could I not? She had to know.
Did he die in the fire?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
You promise to care for her then?
You're in 201 and 202.
What the hell would you call this?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Hello? Hello?
Don't even think about it.
Yes.
Cancer in a box.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
I don't know...
I'm holding your hand!
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Can't what?
I understand something.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
Julie? What's wrong?
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Hello?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
Must have missed the sign.
Can't talk right now.
What is up with that weirdo?
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
My friend -- what can one say --
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
I have forgotten it, dear.
Yes?
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
Oh, now  now look here 
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
The General threatened me.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
It isn't me!
She's . . .
Who is it?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
When'd you see him last?
There it is, good as new.
It will?
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Oh . . .
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Anything I can do back here?
Is it a charge, sir?
Aw, forget it.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Maybe you were born older, George.
How's that?
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
I know, but . . .
Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
It's important.
Well, what do you know  wife.
Why didn't you call me?
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
With coconuts?
Well, I don't.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Ouch!
Have you made up your mind?
Where'd you get that dress?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
After that, who cares?
Yeah, just started.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
I've eaten.
You forgot something.
Great!  Find one for me.
My hair's getting wet!
I can't wait to get there.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Get on the rocks!
Yeah, it's her job.
No.
Yeah.
Shut up.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Happy to do it.
In here.
Because.
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
That's it.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Let's get the kid home.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
No.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
What's wrong?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Martin, it could be anything.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
That's it?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
When?
How old is your cousin?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Me neither.
Anyone know what time it is?
What about sailing?
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
You do everything your parents tell you?
I want Fruit Loops!
I want to go with you!
What's your plan, Brody?
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
What is it, 97 days?
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
My imagination isn't that good.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Not enough loving.
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
Where are you going?
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Michael...
How's your patient?
Mmmm... you smell good.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
How is he?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Michael, you're not going down there.
But you --
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
No!
You look like an orange worm.
Afraid I can't do that.
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
He's a young one.
When did this happen?
How you doing, Kelly?
Massachussettans aren't.
I don't know, it depends.
Depends on big brother.
I'm a water-skier.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Sean, do you have herpes?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Gotta sneeze.
Yes, there is goes.
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
What the hell's there?
Reach for the limit I always say.
Five hundred yards.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
We're in love.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
Stop what?
I see what you're doing....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
You're having a good time....
Promise me you'll be all right....
It could have been an accident....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
I'm fine.
Would you suffer through a dance with me?
That's hard to imagine....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Will you leave me alone...?
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Hey!
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
I didn't ask you to....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
Shit....
You don't like my voice...?
You told me what?
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Cow tipping?
Yes.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Be my guest. What you got?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
No, you didn't.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
So am I. But where's my money?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
Listen to me saying what?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
That isn't what you said before.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
She wasn't lying about the van.
You don't really believe this?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
I'm going up to the institute.
Listen, you don't havta come?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
That's bullshit,
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I've heard you call him Freddy.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
Did Amber have a dog?
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
No.
Ross told me.
Has he got your aunt's address?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
It's not possible right now.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Why does he want to kill me?
Who sought the warrant?
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
What was she like?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Could you just stop moving?
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
He's asleep, right?
... this is... uh... too funny...
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Well, I'm happy for you.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
What --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
You want...
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Call me tomorrow.
You love me now, don't you?
Another drink please.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Damn right.
Why not --
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go the zoo.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
What's going on, Jerry?
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Eric!
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Oh, my God.
What is it?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We can't just...
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
What did you say?
Udesky.
Well what?
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
He could have died.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Where's Dad?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
It looks intact.
Hmm?
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
But then you never get to go in space.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
But he's the head of InGen!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Well, is he?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Where does it say that?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
Where do you think you're going?!
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
We can't stay in here!
It'll hold!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Can you set up?
Oh, God.
Where's Kelly?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
These are dilated.  Take a look.
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
We were right!
Oh, shit.
Not just every six weeks.
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Dr. Grant!
Alan?!
I get ah - -
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
It's anti-nature.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
Yes it is.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
Why?
The kids okay?
I know.
Where does he think he's going?
What?  What can we do?
Hey, we were saving that!
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Go away!
Don't do that!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
We miss you.
They don't bother me.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
Who?
A house?
You watch this garbage?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
So?
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Yeah, what is it?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.
What is it really?
Fine -- terrible.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
It's what I'm paid to do.
... My ... social situation?
I usually take lunch by the River.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
In a small way.
Was there something else?
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
No.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
No, I suppose not.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
I'll bear that in mind.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
That's <u>mad</u>.
... A piece of paper ...
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.
It's gone out so quickly?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Ann ... Ann!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.
Are you gonna start it up?
Yeah.
What's that?
Don't belong?
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Well I have to close up now.
I guess he figured it was better.
I said yes, I see.
What is it?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Mm.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
You remind me of my uncle.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
-- OK --
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Not much point to this, is there?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
What's the matter?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
What am I supposed to say?
Bree --
Go down in my room.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
How is it back there?
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
Has she talked with you since prison?
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Not particularly.
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
When is mommy coming back?
Okay...Same as usual...
I'm sorry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Uh huh...
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there Burger King?
What don't you understand, pal?
Objection!
Six years.
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
A heavy drinker?
No.
I don't recall.
Yes.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted, do you love him?
'Night, Jim.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
How should I know?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
I know....I know.
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
Oh, Christ!
It's going to cost.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
Got it.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
What?
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
No.
General Chiang.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Soon.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
What do you think?
Roughly five thousand men.
Will we be in this war?
In the Pacific Ocean.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
Tell me.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
Much too young.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Jesus Christ!!
I'm laying a spring trap!
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Nothing's real.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
How big do the bears get?
What?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
It's too dangerous for--
That's probably good.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Sorry.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Are we crazy?
We gotta get to Hector!!
No.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
You threw it at me!!
You like Jack?
Should I?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
<u>Kelly</u>--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Wild guess.
<u>You</u>?
<u>You</u>?
What girl?
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
Not yet.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
I have no doubt of it.
No, I came because we need -
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Reasonably so. Yes.
Then please - do this test for me.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No. Tell me why.
Why so briefly?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Yes. I'll tell you.
We leave in the morning?!
Can we rest soon?
He did?
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Maybe...
There was none!
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
Got a reason to stay.
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Yes.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
What?
They know, don't they?
Oh, God, she's out there...
Charge set?
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
It's Sixpack!
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What on earth's the matter with you?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Bacon, see what we got.
You get the guns?
There are no others.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
They were . . .
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
That's no way to answer the phone.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
No.
It must be this one.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
I hope this is the right move.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
What do you mean?
Tom, this is our case.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
That's if I want to see you.
That you, boy?
It's pay day, ain't it?
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Go on.
Yes?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
My van is half full.
How many feet?
The money, the gear!
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
I am, sir.
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
Out of the Army?
We're not running a dating service here.
Private Johnson!
I'm feeling okay--
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Skinny?
Yeah.
Just wondering.
What's that for?
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
How's your room shaping up?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
You going to get married?
Maybe.
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Pleased to meet you.
You get much of that in here?
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
This girl has a child?
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Your mother was a saint.
We don't need a new jail.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
The Perdido thing?
The Sheriff.
Well, you hire illegals--
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
I've seen 'em.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
I'm not open. We were just talking.
It's Saturday.
Three months.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
Murdered him?
He hates me.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Yeah--
I'm going over to the other side.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
Been away. Up to Houston.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Nix?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
How'd you spell that again?
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
What do you mean, "all of us?"
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Please.
Harry.
When do you want me to start?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I can be very persuasive.
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
I wasn't.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
What was that?
Are you all right?
Bad show last night?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Somebody killed him.
--vanished.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Any movie stars buried here?
A ticket home,
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
I'm afraid she's not in.
I tried to pay you off.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
I want to see Swann face to face.
Don't bother.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
She has no real grip on reality.
You need an ambulance.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Yes...
Where'd you learn that?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
Have you been in?
Look, Ma, no wires.
How the fuck do you do that?
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
And he didn't have them?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
No.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
Can you do it?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
I got to go.  I'm late.
Have we met before?
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Try twenty-five.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Hi again, how's it going?
Ok.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Did I scowl at you?
We established that we have no communication.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where'd you grow up?
I know.
You made it.
That's what you said the other night.
You're leaving right now?
I don't think so.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Is this a bad time?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
I guess she's busy.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
You smell weird.
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
And how would you describe him?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
I'll bet.
What do you mean?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
We need to talk.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
We needed to know all we could.
Peter, let go of the chair!
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Maya?  What do you mean?
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Would you sign it for me?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Where is she now?
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
I can't eat before a game.
What?
Need any help?
So what do I do?
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
It means a lot that you came by.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
How'd you get him to say yes?
Yeah, right.
I don't know how to walk in heels.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
What's up with that?
I never knew a girl that could play.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't like flowers.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
I don't.
See you made it.
You having fun?
I can't be nice to a fan?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Quincy...
Hey.
Sorry about your game.
You want to go talk?
What the hell's going on?
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
Funny.  I never did.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
I heard enough.
Then why are you so upset?
One game.  One-on-one.
For what?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
And what happens when you lose?
Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
We still have to go?
Later when?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
You ok?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
It was scary though.
What the fuck do you want?
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
...yeah...
Yes.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
You don't have a boyfriend?
No.
Who was it?
What are you lookin' for?
You just move in here?
Yeah.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
-- do you wanna cup?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
I'm sorry.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
ok.
Let's make a deal.
I'm sorry --
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
You don't know how crazy I am.
please, what is it, please --
It's upstairs.
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
I don't know.
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
Why the hell aren't you in school?
No.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Is it real love?
Well --
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
Yes I do.
I don't know.
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
No.
...cocksucker....
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...Lily...?
She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Is this 509-9027?
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
This isn't meant --
Are you asking me that?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Yeah.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
And what did your parents do?
Does you mother still work?
I wouldn'tve asked --
Do you have your masters?
What name?  My name?
And "Frank?"
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
How long...you think?
About three weeks ago.
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Uh. huh.
I'm really sorry.
Oh yeah.
You're just come in --
I don't have to answer your questions.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
Are you lyin' to me?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
Marcie.
No.
No.
Been drinkin' today?
You look great.
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
No.
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Will you say my name?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
I love you.
It'll take the pain away.
I'm a bad person.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
No one else that I know?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I don't know....
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I think that you know.
...Jimmy...
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
No.
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
What does that mean?
I'm trying to help, Linda --
Linda --
What are you doing?
mmm.hmm.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
yeah.
Do you have that?
The fuck is wrong with you?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
And you were not hurt?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?
No, Louis!  No!
Wh-- Wha--
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
More wine!!
Poor Phillippe!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Pull them back!
Everyone back.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
It is also a place of burial.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
D'Artagnan, unready?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I know.
Athos, please...!
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
What number, on the first page?
Raoul... is in love...
We're by Ozone...
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
What's this?
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
And he took a swing at you?
What?  Wait a minute -
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Could he handle a direct contact?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Run it.
Wait, Will...
I'll pick you up in...
When are you coming back?
There has to be.
Will?
What's that?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
How far away's the back-up?
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Tonic will be fine.
Yes, are you okay...?!
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Who?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Do you feel privileged?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
No. I don't want to see you.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
It's Will Graham...
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
I don't understand.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's right-handed.
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Can you quit?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Meet point's up ahead!
My name's Will Graham. I...
Will it keep them out?
Yeah...
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Yes.
How?
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
You had disadvantages.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Pictures?
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
No.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Tank you veddy much.
People love... comedians.
Those are my terms.
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Hi... am I late?
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
You're a wimp.
Each show is worse than the next.
Sir, do you have a problem?
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Positive.
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
What's in Memphis?
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Bob.
They are dead.  In either case --
And you are?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
What?
Who is it?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You don't, do you?
Are you sure this line is clean?
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
No, it's all right.
Really?
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Goddamnit!
How long?
Right now?
This isn't real?
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
That's why we're here.
Yes I do.
Did you believe in them too?
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
You're the Oracle?
What is the Matrix?
That's different.
Is it?
Should I be?
Are you all right?
Is Morpheus alive?
What happened?
I have to.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Can you fly that thing.
No.
You don't have...
Zion?
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
Where is it?
Holy shit!
See who?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
You're not far from Cypher.
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Neo!
What the hell just happened?
Know where he is?
What are your plans?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
What happened to you Flash?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
There won't be any this week.
Didn't show up.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Keep your mouth shut.
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
OK, ok...
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Oh Michael, look...
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Stripper?
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Hey, where you been?
No, she's got epilepsy.
What was it?
"Francis Macomber."
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Well you can't blame them in a way.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Look who's talking.
Just plain 'Joe'?
Hi, Allison --
Have you got a minute?
Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
I don't like cake.
That you've been to Susan?
Paillarde of veal.
Honey --!
...This shit's not bad.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
And what would that be?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
I didn't say.
Why yes, thank you.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
Do you think I need a haircut?
As close as a deal could be.
Is there any more to it?
No.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
I don't care.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
In English, please.
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Make it go 'way.
The Board is waiting.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
I've got plenty of friends.
Goodnight, Joe.
Oh goodness, no.
Whatever you do.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I appreciate you --
Has her pain abated?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
No.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
It gets worse.
'Love will find out the way'?
I believe that, don't you?
I love you now, I'll love you always --
You think so?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Sounds fair enough.
Joe --?
Yes.
No.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Excellent.  What is it?
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Those were my words, Bill.
I don't expect you to.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
That's me.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You should hope quite a while.
What do you mean?!
Where are you?
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
The 'question' --
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
You mean like you loved Mom?
Don't get carried away.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
So what's wrong with that?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
You're not listening --
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Where is he?
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I could be her.
I've got patients coming in --
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
You said you liked me.
39.
My wife.
Shit. Wrong room.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
You think you can bargain with me?!
So you have information for me?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
Such as?
Where is he?
I'll go see him.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
What?
What are you here for?
Are you Teddy?
I'm not appealing the decision.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
How can you read that again?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Why?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Why are you following me?
Why?
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
It is now.
* Thank you.							    *
Just came in.  She's still alive.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Sure.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Make it 35.
Were you born in Havana?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
What's our deal?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Where we meeting 'em...?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
We're makin' moves on each other.
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
What is going on...?!
Go ahead.
Who are you talking to?
So?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Yeah.
Why?
Define small.
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
What you gonna do back there, East?
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Don't say nothing about you either.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I'm scared.
They gotta be.
Sounds like they knew you.
You're what?
What you got me up here for?
... and taxi fare for me.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Want me to take over?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
For the money... )
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Stupid.
A hundred grams.
That doesn't seem so bad.
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
And?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
That's a great philosophy.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Lawyers?
Lady...
Peter...
H-how do I get...?
Any luck?
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Rub it on the windows!
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
What is it?
It bit you.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
What are they...?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
No, what is it?
I guess that means it's okay.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
Show me the way?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
See, isn't this nice?
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
You really think so?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Why would you lose me?
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Could be the weight of the snow.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
That's nice.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Where?
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Ninety-three point four million.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Well do you disagree with that?
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
How much longer before you can reach him?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
- torque wrench.
- this is very disconerting..
I wouldn't do that.
Indeed.
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Listen to what?
Awfully short notice..
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
Which is?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
What did you think of him?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Yes, I gathered as much.
I don't.  No exactly.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
That simple, huh?
Left jacket pocket?
So what did he say?
Do I?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
Always.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
What are you going to do?
This stuff is so sticky.
Are you damaged?
Yes.
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
Tell you what?
He's our guy.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan.
I knew about Jim.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
I don't know.
Jack...that's spying.
Yes...  Its him.
Whats the problem.
Its not working.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
No, I'm going.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I won't pay for nothing.
Cosmo?
Thank you, Rose.
You're welcome.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
You haven't said anything.
Where's Ma?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
I got it done.
You're my father.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Loretta.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I'm a wolf?
Me neither.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
What?
You don't get along with anybody!
Why not?
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
That was just so... awful!
That's right.
Yeah.
I'm afraid of who I am.
You've gotta get outta here.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
This is a good suit.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Will you live here?
No.
Where you been?
Are you drunk?
She recovered.
You should think about this.
My mother's recovered.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
That's it! That's the reason!
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
I'm sure she did.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
That's my house.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
Yes!
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
A what?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
You said it again!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Then you shall die.
Well, what's that then?
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Hello.
This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
Well, what are you then?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Ni, ni, ni!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
We shall attack at once.
Greetings King Arthur.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Old woman!
Man!
Be quiet!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Exactly.  So... logically ...
Thanks very much.
Did you kill all those guards?
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
But, Father.
Who are you?
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Until you, or anyone else ...
No, It's nothing!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Sir Gawain.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Stop saying the word!
Look.  I'm warning you.
So?
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
It's what the maids are for.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
Checked and locked, sir.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
It's the Queen's decision.
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
How will I know?
I need a man who knows where I am.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
That can wait till the weekend.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Aye.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Aye, ma'am.
What?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
That doesn't make him an expert.
Must they always follow us?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Then why send me back to them?!
I came as quickly as I could.
Then they may read about me.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
The question is, do we need her?
Mrs Brown.
What's her excuse this time?
Erysipelas.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
How long has he been this sick?
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Read it.
Why not?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What is it?
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Where is my son?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
How do you stop The Screamer?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person.  Now.
Where to now?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
What are you looking for?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
Okay.  It's West.
The clock's already ticking.
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I'm okay.
It's the wrong way!
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
The Cowboy??
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
There is no problem.
Howdy!
Beautiful night.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
What did I say?
Wow!
Your Aunt called me.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Are you okay?
What?
Yes?
Mulholland Drive.
Okay.
What's wrong with that?
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Good luck!
Do you know them?!
But I want to.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
No, we don't.
Go ahead.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Interesting.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Hardly.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
Leave him, he's dead.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
Is this really the time ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Just stop it. End it here.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
I thought you made this place ?
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Is it over ?
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Yes sir.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Sir ?
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
No. I am not a homosexual.
What's next ?
<<belch>>
What the ... ?
The power went out in half the park.
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
What now ?
Why don't you shut up now.
You had to remind me?
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Yeah.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
It's just a corpse.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Then what did she do?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Hello.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Vada?
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
Change my name.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
But...are you engaged or something?
Committed?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Lock the door.
Maybe.
He was caressing.
You're Nick's mother?
Not exactly.
Nothing, nothing at all.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Did it hurt a lot?
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Wanna play?
It's there.
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Stiffs??
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
No, why?
It's only eight o'clock.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Pointing upwards Look...
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Why?
Feeding my fish.
Yes.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
He's okay isn't he?
I found this.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
I'm very nervous.
Oh come on.
Are you sure about all this?
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Hi.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Thirty five dollars.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
For this class?
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
No.
Why do you think she says that?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Yes it is.
Can we look around in your camper?
Uh huh.
No, I'm divorced.
No.
I like my name.
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Daddy??!?!?!
Goodnight.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
Oh no!  UUH.
I'm trying.
What's wrong with your eyes?
What?
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
THIS!! 
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Why are you running away?
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No.
Like this?
Close your eyes.
I should look different.
You don't miss much.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
You have a real philosophy of life.
I wish.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Don't you have to be somewh...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
No.
But he always says...
Exactly what?
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
W...
Such as.
She's too genuine.
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You're not eating.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
Dance card filled?
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
No accents today.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
Michael...
Lower.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
What do you have to buy?
Don't feel that way, honey.
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
What's wrong with her.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
What do you really want?
You bet.
He knows better.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
He has that sign with the tree.
What!
Whose?
Hey!
He's my father.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
Replacement party.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
Nash.
The car broke down.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
No, I don't.
Hello.
I have to go.
I can't.
When did you think it would happen?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
Well...
That's what you said before.
I'm not sure...
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Sorry I'm late.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Hello.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
I know a couple.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
You think I should take lessons?
You think it will?
I see.
What did you think then?
Divine intervention.
Thank you, sir.
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
How come you never talk?
Was what worth it?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Just wait one fucking minute.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yeah baby.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Roger?
What's the travelling arrangements?
Who?
Are you all set?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
What are we talking about?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
People seen him 'round.
How 'you doing?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Been over to the other mill?
You working?
Went to college, huh?
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
No.
No thanks.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Let's go, Duff.
How come you stay 'round here?
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Ain't your fault.
Thank you.
Everything you cook is good.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Huh?
Don't, Duff.
Don't deny me, Duff.
About ten dollars.
Day work.
You heard me!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
How come you don't hate their guts?
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
How 'bout the key?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How 'you gonna live?
Don't be too hard on him.
Who is?!
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Shut up, Will.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
What the hell is that?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
And then?
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We got problems topside.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
How much time you got left?
Less than thirty minutes.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
Wait... You hear that?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
It sounds like you.
Case...
Yeah... fine.
Something exotic I hope.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
How long will they watch us for?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Yes, it's lame.
What?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Roger in Op/Ed.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Bridgework?
Cuuuute!
Do I want to be crunched?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
Do you remember high school?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Better than I...
I-
Dorothy Parker--
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Thank you.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Do you think you'll find her?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
You ruined the whole thing!
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Are you having fun?
By name.
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Yes.
Taste it.
Uh-huh.
We're here!  You sent for us!
Just out for a while.
It's not the gas, Dad!
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
Jesse, help!
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
You mean a shithead.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Disappointed?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it?
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
I thought I'd wait for you.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
I used to live in this house.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
What?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Doesn't matter.
We can try again.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
What are we going to do?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Who would know where they were hidden?
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
And what are they?
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
We've got work to do.
What was that?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
Cooling down.
What did you think?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Hi.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
I'm an actress.
Fifteen million dollars.
No.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
I forgot my bag.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Okay.
Too complicated.
She left me.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Cartwright.
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
How are you doing?
How do you think I'm doing?
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
He wouldn't say.
Anna Scott?
No!
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Yes.  What do you think?
Well, thanks, that's great.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
That's right -- Topol.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
No, don't think I do.
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
No, 'fraid not.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
Oh my God...  Hello.
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Please see to Mister Bromden.
B-B-Billy.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
So long, kid.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
Ca-na-da...
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
They must be up there!
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Ya know what, Fred?
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Okay, sucker.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
Right!
Yeah, it's cold!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
That's correct, Doc ...
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
How much ya wanna bet?
Yeah, what's up?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Hey, how ya doin'?
What are they?
Please follow me.
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Tha's your problem.
Is everything all right?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Your grandmother?
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Let's find a telephone.
Your great aunt.
I'm a liberal!
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Where are you going?
How could you do this to me?
Uh, I'd rather not say.
He's out by the pool right now.
And she's a knock-out, too.
So were you.
Yeah.
You aren't?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Sure.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Kate, is something the matter?
Is that bad?...
But it's July.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
I just got a dial tone--
We're saved!
Your brother?
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
And then what, Faith?
Like a detective.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
I know, but...
It was a ouija board, remember?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Yes.  He is.
Uh huh.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Thanks.
Right now?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's 
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I know. I know.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
Father Barry.
They play pretty rough.
In braids? That's right.
I can get home all right from here
I'd better go in.
That was nice of you.
I don't know.
In a saloon?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Edie... Edie... ..
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Edie.
Am I on my feet...?
I don't want to hear it in there.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
You can!
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
I'm just resting my feet.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Is Johnny in?
Hit me again.
You ought to go home and take care of that
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I was only talkin' to her.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Keep Charley out of this.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
Can't we get out of here?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
The time...is short.
Is there time?
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
No. No! No!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
And the one driving the other car?
What're you talking about?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
Till they got busted.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Jack?
Nice disguise.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You'll have to ask him.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Call and tell you.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
So you've done this before, huh?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
You comfy?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
How many was that?
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
That's my dad.
And your gun.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Those guys bother you?
You like bourbon?
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
Well, does it make sense to you?
You really wear that suit.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
She did, huh.
You know I saw you on the street.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Whose blood you got all over you?
I hear six.
Thanks for your help.
Really?
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
It's a little late for me.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
You gonna write me a check?
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
For a time.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Why's that?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
I can tell.
Moselle Miller?
Was a she, name Tuffy.
It's beautiful.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Technically.  They're separated.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
He waved to you?
You wave back?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So?
I told you, he isn't here.
How do I look, mama?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Midge.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Yeah.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Then why are you looking for her?
Sorry.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
It's tight.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Yeah.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Danny's not coming?
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
Learn English, then!
I'm not telling.
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Charlie...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
You got a Tab?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Yeah. Like that.
Where did you get that sweater?
Great, isn't it?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You really love me, don't you?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That's real big of you.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Oh, God, Dion.
Hello, Charlie.
Yes, sir.
Are you for real?
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
When did you start drinking coffee?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
And the butter.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
What a great kite.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Silicon is from sand.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
Just out.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
Fuck you.
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Ready for what, baby?
About my blood work?
Congratulations.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
You survived your first gay party intact.
I'll look over the Q and A.
Are you a good lawyer?
What do you love about it?
Rach.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
What can I do?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
In some situations.
No. I can't really see it.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Were you recently promoted?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Get real.
In a word, yes.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Lots.
Duh...
Since when?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Don't wanna miss this.
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
What whispers?
Heard about it. Just never seen it.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
How many bottles?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
Let's just be sure.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Little ratty-ass.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
Why did I fall on you?
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You know who Muhammad was?
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
One is all?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
SULEIMAN!
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Well, you got the big gauge.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
What's her name, anyway?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
No.
'Then how do you account for me?,
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
But how long is a day?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Taylor -- quit riding him.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Huh?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Climb off me, will you!
Don't bother
Can we take a dip?
Zira doesn't want your female.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
I think you're making a mistake.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
Tell him to pull back!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Which one?
Are you going to take her with you?
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Fuck you bitch.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Dawn! That was it!
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
You volunteered for this shit man?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
What are you talking about! 
Found it. Growing in a garden.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't know.
I'm sure you have.
Would you mind?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Good morning. Can I do something for you?
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
What did you say his name was?
As I said before...
Whatever you say.
Much too late.
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Nice of him.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Bad?
Just who are you, anyway?
I didn't notice him.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Anything I can do about it?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Wonder what?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Yes, Miss.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
Because you think your in love with me?
Name it.
Private eye?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
How are your teeth getting along?
What?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
It was lying where on the balcony?
The only answer I have for you.
That COULD BE TOLD.
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
Lay off, can't you?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
How would you know, Brandon?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
Got a moment, Inspector?
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
You get it's brother.
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
Do I know who lives down there?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
No suicide.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I don't know, sir.
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
Years, why?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
It's terribly good.
No.  I'd want to--
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
I think it went on rather too long.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Both dead.
Again?
In radio we're different.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
I might.
Might?
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
And the Argies.
Let me see.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Yes, finally.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
You're a piece of shit
Thanks.
What period?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Dad.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
U-huh.
You're so famous now.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
One shot stopping.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
You gonna pull?
What's this?
But you're not alone.
Wild ride, huh?
I'm not FBI anymore.
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
A little mushy.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
You had enough?
I... I gotta go.
Well, I saw you and--
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
We're going to need everyone.
What have you got in mind, General.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
I think it's Hawkins.
He knows our defenses.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
There's no way you could know that.
I like your hat.
No.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Yes.
I... I would take advantage of it.
Three hundred.
Good morning.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I sell them.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Fuck off.
What's that?
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
What do you mean?
Vivian...
Edward, did you hear me?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Doing what?
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
You sure you won't come with me?
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
You bullshittin' me?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.
I'm just going to my room.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
Me?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
What is with you?
What?
Get out!
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Who are you?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how can you be sure?
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
We'll never survive.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
And a good thing too.
Why is that, do you think?
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
It's you.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
What?
-- well, when does it get good?
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
It won't be easy, Sire.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Who won? How did it end?
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Now?
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
What? What?
Sir. Sir.
Slow going?
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Tell me.
I must know.
Kill me quickly.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Congratulations.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Yes sir.
I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What scheme?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Right.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
What is she gonna do here?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Do you think he'll take the job?
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Oh, the best one.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
You out to buy a motel?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
How early?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Cash.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
What's your interest?
Must've needed it.
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Five hundred.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
I want to know if my sister is here.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
What do you know about it?
Yes.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Probably on his way back right now.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Yes.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Am I that close to Fairvale?
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
You eat like a bird.
Except you.
Norman.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Went out before service.
I'll take you to...
I'll get your bags.
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
Shut up!
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
He's inherited a fortune.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
That's it. You get it quick.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I don't agree with you.
I think so.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
So that's the way it is?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Let me go! Let me go!
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
You mean he was colored?
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Which one is me? The horse?
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
It's all yours.
That's what I said.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
How much money have you got?
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
You did.
You did miss --
Mia...?
Dysfunctional --
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Well, some fiend might.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Five hundred rabbits?
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
The new girl is here.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Why is it taking so long?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
I am ahead of you.
I think we both know her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Boys? You say to me boys?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
How is she?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Tennessee?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
Mother... is Rose going to die?
More history, Rose.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
Indivisible and inseparable.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
What and?  That's what I got.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Who cares?
What... ?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Lay off once, would you?
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
We should slow down.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Where we going?
I can't believe we're stealing.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
General Jim Beam, then.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
There probably is.
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well, sir...
I... I think I can... clarify...
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
You get him?
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
I can't kill my own father.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
I thought she was with you.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
Good shot, Red Two.
Quiet.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Well, I'm sorry.
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
I've got something to say.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
No no no, no no.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
It's Thanksgiving.
I don't think you're a bum.
Do you have a phone?
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Don't you open them anymore?
Like?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
That so.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
It's not your house --
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You's the novelty, Champ!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Damn.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
...It's very American.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Why?
...That's an old one.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Seven minutes!
Here -- Three minutes.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Ya sure?
What?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
I like yella teeth.
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
Yeah.
Rice is a bum.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Fifty years, huh.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How am I doin'?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
What's ya sister like to do?
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Whatta these guys want?
What can I do about it?
Apollo's a great fighter.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
A tweeting bird?
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
Doom.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
I've already seen your photographs.
You tricked me, damn you!
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Wrong number?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Leave Me!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Teach me how I should forget to think.
I'll not endure him.
Good marrow, father!
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Welcome.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Well what shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Well, what was yours?
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I didn't say I was.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
That fucking figures...
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
Here's yours.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
Then where is it?
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
So what do we do?
That's it.
American.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
So this is what, a test?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Eat shit and die slowly...
To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
Same thing, isn't it?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
It's my job.
I'm not here very much.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Gaelic.
You sure?
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Ten thousand right here.
No.  We can't.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
That's right!
At the expense of six people.
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
Well what are we supposed to do?
It's gonna be o.k.
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
And you're solid on that?
What's your offer, Jesse?
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
How are ya?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
How the hell did he find it?
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
I know.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Yeah, I've seen him.
What?
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Why?
What are you getting at?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
Hmmm...
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
How much is that?
Two-hundred thousand!
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
I said get on your feet!
Oh, you American?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
No.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
You said --
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Slow down, baby.
She's getting undressed.
There's people up here!
I wouldn't do that!!!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
No.  I'm going to find out.
That your gate down there?
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Why don't you go get them?
Are you okay?
Baby Duck?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Did you tell Sterling?
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
What is your name?
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Where were we?
Witnesses.
Right....
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You know War?
Yes, I think so.
No, fish is a PM food.
Like that.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
You got a lot of guts calling me.
I'm talking about the girl.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What are you talking about?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You sonuvabitch.
Hello.
Ambassador Han.
You have what I asked for?
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
We do it to our dog.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
I already made an appointment for later today.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Unbelievable, she got to you.
What?
Thank you.
Like her mother.
Getting nervous?
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
Highly suspect.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
You were not.
I'm listening.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
No, no.  You're her best friend.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
You don't love me, is that it?
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
I love you.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Does it have wheat in it?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Right.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
I know.
Go home for the weekend.
Please --
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
It's you.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
You don't like the one he was now?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
Eighty dollars.
Dad --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
So I can go.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Jed's got cables.
Is that what she used to sing?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
It's only ten o'clock.
I was thirsty.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Did too.
Do you like it?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
How's Jonah taking it?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
You could have called me --
Take a drink. Calm down!
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
A meeting?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
This is what we've been waiting for.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Lus! Come down here!
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
What attitude?
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh God.
How?
Oh. Hi.
How far out of town?
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
How much time do you have?
Really, I don't want to.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
I don't want to leave you.
Twelve
Sorry.
That's a good one.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
So, why'd you want to see me?
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Fuuuuuck
Can your man handle that?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
Palmdale
Yes, Jimmy.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Why?
I don't trust anybody.
What does that mean?
But I just met you.
Why do you say that?
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What the hell is this?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
I thought you'd be happy.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Please ... don't do this ...
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
What's that smell?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Where's Bubba?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
That must be four thousand yards.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Y'all come back.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Watching.
I heard.
Good luck, Captain.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
GO!
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Hell of a mission.
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
You alright?
Yeah.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
What do you think?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Trust me, you're the best.
Sure, Reiben.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
Why's that?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
Understanding the following rights...
This evening is over.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Hey, sis.
Yeah.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
C'mon Lloyd.
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
Why?
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I won?
Okay, I give up.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're going.
You're not listening to me.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Honey, it's not what you think.
Honey, about what?
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
Job?  Being a great date.
Today is tomorrow.
Nice one.
Yeah?
What did you say?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah.
No.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
What's wrong?
You need to study?
No, no.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
It's your castle, man.
Jim Court?
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
So what's up?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Ooop, excuse me.
Oh, I was just going to...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
You took my workers.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
That's great, thanks.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
What?
They arrived.
I didn't do enough.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Would it do any good?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
thought he was doing AA.
Outside.
I'm losing you.
Cici. Who's this?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
Can we talk?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
You could start with an apology.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Its over, Cotton.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
And are the police sure about that?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
Finish what my son started.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
Dewey?
Oh--a God complex
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm sorry.
It's good to see you involved.
Where is your attacker?
The young girl is slashed again.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
Take it off.
But...
You ass.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
Asshole, Can't talk.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
To see your reaction.
Can I help you?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
You seem to like movies, Detective.
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
They found another note?
And?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
You're not a detective.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Your life?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Gale he's got Dewey!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Where?
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Hello?
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
I thought she was dead.
Billy? What the...
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
I wanna let go. I do...
I called my dad.
What number are you trying to reach?
Do I?
Hello.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Really? What?
I don't know.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Yes?
I believe you...
No...
No... please.
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
What's his name?
...please... no...
No, not yet.
What brings you out to these parts?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
So is Dewey your real name?
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.
What is she doing here?
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
Yeah.
She's tough.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
What is it? Where's Casey?
Where is she?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
So who are you?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
LEAVEMEALONE!
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Why are they doing this?
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
TATUM!
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
For once, Stu, drop it.
What do you think?
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
Yeah.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
A woman...
Murderers like you?
Drop it.
No.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
No fingerprints?
This is the one thing.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
How did the fire fight end?
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
We don't know for sure...
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
What?
Did the wife confess?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
And you think we got a chance to find her?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Never heard of him...
Stay out here.
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Not no more.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
She'd be about thirteen now...
We got two around that age...
Where?
Cherry-red Tears.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
Martin, what-
I really hate to bother him, but...
Ellen Straub.
I've killed my husband!
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
It's good.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
The title?
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
Yes, I saw it.
There's never any
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Where are you going?
Now where? Will?
I feel a scene coming on.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
Cut round him for now.
Romeo.
By God, I wish I knew.
Another little problem.
And yours?
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
The daughter of his enemy.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Like Valentine and Silvia?
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
I am.
You would not leave me?
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
I know how to fight!
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
Nor you for me.
My lady Viola.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
And break her heart and mine?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Just serve.
What?
I don't have time.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
No.
A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
But not quite.
I want to talk now.
How much did you pay?
Security.
Yeah?
Cover it?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
I don't know.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
That's it, then.
Yes, thanks.
Yes.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
-- which is --
-- which is a hack.
Have you seen Hugo?
Yes.
I don't thinkI can.
Sshh.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Leave him alone.
And the money?
Aren't you going to answer it?
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
You mean I can have the room?
I see.
Is this where no one stays?
Expecting anyone?
I'm sorry.
So let's go.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
Eh --
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Hello.
What happened to that guy?
The telephone? It continues to ring.
The human condition.
I write about it?
What?
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Sorry?
Is it real?
Maybe... why do you ask?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Gee, that's very serious...
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
You're looking great, baby.
Whatever you say.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
What about?
But aren't you...
Oh, no.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
Shit.
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
I am not!
Right now?
She is.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
He's a very private person, actually.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
... I don't get it done often.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
-- what?
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
He still having parties?
We're friends.
I've got to leave?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
Don't go, Jackie...
Don't leave me...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
-- you know better...
Here in the canyon.
What's gonna happen?
Well, like what?
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Fine. How are you?
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
Do you really mean that?
Yeah, baby...
Yeah.
Go where?
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
George.
Okay.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
No, but I think they might.
When?
Where's your car?
What business meeting?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Now, Jackie --
How come you took your own car?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
George...
George...
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But what?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Now wait a minute...
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
Wasn't sure it was you.
I'll call you back...

You're home.
You do?
Then you were talking to him.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
I'd like a drink.
Aren't you going to have one?
Does she know about us?
Fine.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Is he an enemy?
Sort of.
I'm terribly sorry.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
You're kidding.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
No, it's not that...
No.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Have they sat down?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Room 237?
Yeah, I guess so.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Oh,
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Tony.
Well how can I repay you?
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Sure.
Bill, how do you do?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Jack!
I...
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I don't believe they did.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Fine.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
What's the money for?
Where's Mom?
You booger.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Huh?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Well... was it a prescription?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
I saw what I saw.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
I think I hear it!
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
What did who say?
You are so damn sexy.
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Yes, Betty?
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Hurry, Sister!
What?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Babies
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
What?
Three years.  A rookie.
You have to help me
Mary Clarence!
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
St. Anne's?
It has come to pass.
Are you talking about me?
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
What's wrong with my life?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Really catching on.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
Oh?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
Okay -- no limo.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I have?
How?
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Then one day they find you.
We're looking for Mike.
But you didn't tell me!
A nun?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
It didn't work, Vince.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Certainly not.
What the hell are you doing?
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
What?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Not for lack of trying.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
What is the common thread between these victims?
We should not go much further in this murk.
All I saw was their lantern.
Did your father take a loan?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
He has proposed to me twice.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
There is no such thing as magic.
If you want.  But...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What are you on about?
And this gives worth to butchery?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
What is so urgent?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
The church.
Yes, actually.
Use caution.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
What did you say?
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
Well, I guess it's all good.
French-fried potaters.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
What?
Leave.
What's in your bag?
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
What numbers do you punch?
I reckon I feel all right.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Did you want to play ball with us?
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
They still around, your folks?
How did your mama die?
Maybe they needed it.
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
All right then.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
You all right, Mama?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Huh?
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
You walk fast, don't you?
Yeah.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
I mean tomorrow or the next day.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
I reckon not.
I've heard it said that way.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I didn't mean that.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
What's that, Sol?
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
I didn't know you took pictures.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
They're all the same.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Like what?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
You what?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
And what's that supposed to mean?
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
Open it.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
And how much are these?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Thanks for the tip.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
I just want to know where he is.
And?
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Not a one.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
And have you mended them?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
The what?
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Is it yours?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Well?
Why?  If they could never take title.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
It is.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
Did you write that column?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
I did.  Boy.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
You're wondering why I held it.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
You think so?
What for, Sheriff?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
What makes you think I play?
Apparently.
Well...
Is it possible?
Carl never lied.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Funny?  In what way?
Upsy-daisy.
A what?
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Those two musicians from the garage!
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
We're not?
But suppose it doesn't?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
Done what?
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like when?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Sugar?
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Good night, honey.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Interesting.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
What's that?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
I always did.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Where did you girls play before?
Yes.  For a whole year.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
You don't say.
You're not sure?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Why?
Who?
Daphne...
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
Oh?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
It's not the backs that worry me.
We got it second-hand.
Running away?  From what?
Rough?
I'll say.
About what?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
No, my flag steward.
Well, I'm not.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Complete washout.
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Is that anything?
Really?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Daphne -
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
We got different information.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
I sleep with my spats on.
Spats Colombo.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Are you sure youre okay?
Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.
If Ed ever found out....
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Um, just about everyone.
You heading to the train station?
No.
Crikey.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
I dont know.
No, count it, anyway.
What is?
This happened to you?
How did you know that was me?
What?!
I guess so.
Are you sure?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
I should go.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Dad!
Yeah.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Colored.
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
Can you swim?
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Yes, sir...
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
What's that, son?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
I don't look like no possum!
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
What's that you carryin'?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Come, I'll take you home.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
I wanta get some things.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
What?
Okay.
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Who the hell made up that law?!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Kyle?!
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Mrph?
No... The General is right.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Oh my God...
I don't know, dude.
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
What's going on Terrance?
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
Cool!
You don't have watches?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
I think we're moving.
Oh Sara...
Anna...
Excuse me?
You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
Were you going to give it to them?
On channel 10?
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
What did you say to me?
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Explosive?
What?  What are you talking about?
And what are you going to do?!
But how are you going to escape?
What the hell are you doing?
So close...
Will you marry me?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
Is there anything I can help you with?
I'm going back for Taylor!
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Sure, Sid.
- canker sore.
How do you turn this thing off?
Think he bought it?
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
I'm sure you have Buzz.
100 years! 
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Grace Skinner.
I do what I gotta do to survive.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I never saw you.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Son?
Buzz Fazeli.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Nice set-up.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
This is a vicious cycle.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Do you talk with your mom?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
More than you could afford.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
You should.
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!
How big is this spacecraft?
Back away then.
What is it?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
They told me about sixty hours.
Nobody move.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I don't know.  That's the point.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
I see it.
Well, where the fuck is he?
It's chipped.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
Resetting the sub.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
What about you?  What happened to you?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
Norman.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry?
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I would.  But my suit --
What's the matter?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Fixing it.
That wasn't in there before.
You don't believe me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
He translated it wrong.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Diphenyl parlene.
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Three to six hours.
How fast does it take effect?
You know what I mean.
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
But --
That's when you went in the sphere.
That's bullshit.
Get away from me!
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Like what?  I'm not --
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
Don't be defensive.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
What is that?  That noise?
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Getting anywhere with those?
You didn't say that about the food?
The three of us.
Missed.
Hold on.
Gimme a second --
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
English?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
Do you?
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
You want me to try?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Squint harder.
Try this one.
Who's going to pay me then?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'll get the information.
Who are you anyway?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
How can you store an energy field within you?
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
Are you all right?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
The Kiber Crystal.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
You don't believe in the Force?
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
We'll send a squad up.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
And you?
See Threepio... do you copy?
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
WHERE IS IT ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Where are you going ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
You're late.
Do you mean it ?
What happened to your hair ?
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
What ?
What's that, Diz ?
Diz, see what you can do.
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Best in the Fleet !
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Kill the bitch.
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Our data is being prepared.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Permission to speak freely, sir?
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Forward motion, Captain...!
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Evening, Annie.
Cal...
I need a typewritter.
I have one, but they lost it.
Who?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
I quit the movie.
Yes.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
Everyday things...yes.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
What I need to <u>say</u>...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Me?
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Uh huh.
...lost the screw...
You believe that?
Why?
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Is it...
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
What is it all about?
Water or mineral deposits.
What, what what are you doing here?
What are they offering?
I wasn't doing business.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
I'm sorry.
They're holding it for ransom.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
You can go...
You do...?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Thank you.
She's absolutely r...
But not that <u>way</u>...
But we...
We're just talking about the...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
I...I...
...I know...I know...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
The minute I read that script I said...
I know...
...he's the producer of the movie.
Arrest him.
And what was it you wanted to say?
My wife's going to have a baby.
The writer.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Hi!
You can't write it?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
That's what I said.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Mmm.
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
You hear that?
...the damn thing...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Actually.  I could only help him.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
No.
But you told us to starve.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Yes.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
So you're okay.
Where Ben?
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
I'm worried.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Called him.  We set an ap...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
It's temporary.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Machines do not EAT message.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
My boss.
Did I hear the word...
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
It's just not the right time t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Looks nice enough to m...
And I'm going to win.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
No problem.
What a great surpri...
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
I'll be your guest!
Nice to have you here.
Great to be here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
This is work.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Speak English.
My baby.
You have a bay?
Oh. How did it happen?
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
Is everything OK?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
One in a million recover.
Ni...
Say, 'Nigger.'
Again!!
OK.
I believe it.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Yeah?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Doubt it.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
So where'd you get in?
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
How well do you know this place?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Come on, drink up.
I don't want any...
I insist...
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Possibly some coffee?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
My seven body orifices????
That's right, fella.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Yes!
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Does the threat board show anything?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I don't think so, sir.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Do you think they would cheat?
I presume the planes are armed?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
How long will it take to receive them all?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
War.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Check.
Just the missiles.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Primary arming switch.
No kidding.
Check target approach.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Master safety.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
Yes, Major.
What happened?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
You tell me.
I said that's the point!
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
That was really great.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
It's really not about anything.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Any gunshot victims?
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
It's your birthday?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Good.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
No, no.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
I know, man.
You know?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Wait. Hey, man.
What she doin' in the van, man?
What?
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Oh, you were there?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Hi.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Mm.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Oh, sure.
I'd love to read that.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Erica, you coming?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Why? Because I give a shit?
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Jeff! Come up here!
What?
I don't know.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Hey!
Yeah.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
What?
Really?
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Like?
You do not!
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
Fucking drunk, huh?
I'm in, too.
Diane?  Diane!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
You sure?
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
Hi, Jack.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Spit from your dad?
I sure do.
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...
Oh... What are you working on?
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
You want us to help you pick up?
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
My what?
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
I'll take it.
Thank you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Are you hungry?
You'll be waiting for me?
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
May I say you smell real special.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Hello, young fellow.
Yes, I did.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Yeah?
I wrote that with my heart.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
When did he say it, Norma?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
He must be quite a guy.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
Yes, I am, Norma.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
That's what I told them.
Good.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Bring something to drink.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
But what will happen?
A Storm Dragon?
Eliminate her.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Maybe it was just an accident.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
What's that?
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
She said it wouldn't last.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Well, there's several ways to go .
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Well...I guess I can't.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh, no thanks.
Did anybody notice you?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
What are you making:
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I'd rather not talk about it.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
What? Me?
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
A cheap trick.
What's it like?
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
I knew it!
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Goodbye...
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You look wonderful.
I just can't stand this.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
I can never get a way from it.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
Say!
You're the best, Lois.
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
The boss wants to see you.
Columbia.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Who is she?
Why do I have to do this?
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
What terrific story?
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
What's wrong?
So?
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Yes! This time we got it right!
Anybody been hurt?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
You're not selfish at all.
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
You'll have to pack quickly.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
It's beautiful.
What's a curl?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Sensible enough.
Shhhhhhh!
You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
I'm not so sure you do.
No Paris?
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Where's Clark?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
He's . . . cold. . .
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
You're a great architect, Albert.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
Not unless you can fly.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
You're happy, aren't you?
We just take it?
What do you suggest, my dear?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
It's a ...baby.
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
He will be odd, different.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
You've got me? Who's got you???
Who...who...
Wha'...what are you doing here?
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Do you like pink?
Very much.
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Yes.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
I hope she gets better.
My name is...
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Why are you telling me this?
They just finished supper.
Are you sure?
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Billy, please.  The children.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
Why not?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Yes.
Good night, Billy.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
I have to.
Why?
Because I have to.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
Were his parents...attentive to him?
That's right.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
I did.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
It's for the school bazaar.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Is this mine?
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
The people in the town?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
Have they ever been busted?
Why can't you talk to me?
Daddy?
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Some more wine?
No.
You've been retained?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
I was scared.
The ramp?
Do you like the colour?
It's okay.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Nothing good on your T.V.?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Who said Sidney?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!
Can I come in for a minute?
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
That's the third time he's called today.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
It is a favor, isn't it?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
If the stores are open -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
My mission is to protect you.
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Why?
What?
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
Chill out, dickwad.
Alriight!!  My man!
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
Drive for a minute.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
Can it be destroyed?
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Relax now, Sarah --
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Eating is eating... and...
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
So what is it?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Not yet.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
You live here, in Berlin?
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
Sure.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Steve Arnold...
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Do you know what's in this archive?
Major.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
He did?
Who's he?
And ask him about his private life.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Sure.
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Yes, Chuck?
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Can you handle it?
Alright, the beige one.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
Just let me go.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
What's he like?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Kyle?
Hot dogs?
Not possible.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
A girl.  You know.
I don't think I like this.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
Why were the other two women killed?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I could fight you on this.
Did you play recently?
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
You don't talk to me like that.
I'm so sorry.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
What's with him?
This can't be real...
Why not?
No.
You're the one who started running.
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Where are we going?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
Do you mind if I sit?
Take the picture out.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
Where'd you get that... ?
That's not true...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
Don't move, you bitch... !
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Like... where are you from?
One brother, one sister.
No.
Underwear?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Like a stroke?
Yeah, almost...
What have they been doing to you?
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Stop this.  It's not true...
Really?
I need your car, Elizabeth.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
No, thank you.
I've been so lonely.
Fine.
Ilsa... you're alright?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
His behavior... ?
What the fuck... ?!
Nicholas...
Just what I told you.
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
That could have been worse.
Sure.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
I didn't do it.
Yeah.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Eleanor, how was the drive?
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Why?
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
What happened?
When do we take the tests?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Is there something about the house?
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
Mrs. Dudley.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
It's all I could afford.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Is it over?
Theo... Did you?
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
What kind of food?
Why not?
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
No reason.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
This ain't your lot?
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Not much -- you?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Sort a few things out.
What was that, then?
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Here, are you always this sarky?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
What line is he in.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
Are you serious.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Overnight.  What about just now?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
How far?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Where is he now?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
You sure?
Been away a lot.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
-- You know his name is Frank.
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Ah.
I don't.
Ann--
Hello, Rachel.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
He didn't say that.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
Sure.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
That'll be fine.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Ed, I...
Uh-huh.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Please, Ed.
But it's...
Just coffee.
Where you going?
...What a knucklehead.
Honey.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
...Did you make that up?
...How you today, Ed?
You don't got a headache?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Uh-huh.
Mr...?
Doesn't bother me.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
His eyes are open.
Someone broke into this room.
Anything missin'?
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
What doors?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Dr. Frock?
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
This room sucks.
I don't want to go this way.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Stop!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Oh... my... God!
You loved him.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
Where did you see it?
Dr. Green...
What was it?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
Why would we--
What music?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Nothing was real.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Marlon--
Sorry, I'm way behind.
I told you I can't.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Well, what do you think?
How did it go today?
I've been thinking--
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You hate gambling.
So why do you want to go?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Who were you talking to?!
It looks so small.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
We don't even know you.
What do you do?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Of what?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
I'm looking for him.
Who sent you?
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
What do you think?
That would be my guess.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Had you.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Get dressed, Scully.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
Why are you whispering?
Evidence of a massive infection.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
He didn't mention a park.
What are my choices?
Yeah, well they may this one.
Mulder --
Where'd they go?
I have. I did. It's done.
What? What happened?
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I can't go any farther.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Agent Mulder --
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
My god...
Miriam...
Don't bring it home in this.
...a pocketful of rye.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
...give a kiss to Edward.
You're the shrink, you tell me.
What happened?
Wait...
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Little boy?!  That's him!
Thank you.
You liked him?
You're kidding me.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Catherine!
Any psychiatric medication?
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Sit down.
In German?
Gestern bein heurigen...
What's that?
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I thought you wanted...
A parrot...Let it go.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
I shall be all right.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
Oh, well.
...anyway?
You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
No.
Where's Harry?
I don't want it.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
You a friend of Lime's?
Yes.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Him dying like that.
Miss Schmidt.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
This is where he vanished.
What time is it?
I know a very good dentist.
Never heard of him.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hmm.
You've got plenty of contacts.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
The Roumanian?
Dr. Winkel?
Vinkel.
Find out?
Hear the details.
Excuse me!
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Yes?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Why?
Richard - I saw a fin!
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
I'm sorry.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
One kilometer
Have you told someone?
What's a fascist?
They don't have extermination camps.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
That's a movie, you moron.
How come you know all this shit?
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
I don't care about money.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Why no silencer?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Oh, really?
Why won't you talk to me?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Where are they?
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
V'asitem...
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
You want a punch in the mouth?
That's a much easier game.
I thought there were people here....
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
Obviously.
That would be a catastrophic mistake.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Is it okay if I record this?
I agree.
A poison...?
And? WHat did you notice?
Female...
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
What were you, following me?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How did you get the fucking number?
What part of Germany are you people from?
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
A Jewish prayer.
Shut up. Fuck you....
That's all we've got left.
Why? Why would she?
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
Are you an artist?
You remember Miriam....
Who'd you kill?
How?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
We tested the new bomb.
Eat shit....
He's shy, not like Enzo.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Did you tell him?
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
What's happened??
The Italian, I presume?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Lira?
Where did you get that?
It isn't lit yet.
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Here...  Here...
... Yes.
I don't know... why?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
You jumped in?
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Why?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
You'll try again tomorrow?
Anything.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Will he understand Spanish?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
What was that!?
Yes Esther.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Esther!
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
But we're not open on Sundays.
What's wrong with him?
Cool. What's it do?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What are you doing?
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Mmmyes.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 
Oh, that's so interesting!
Show business?
Yes?
Come to look around?
It was you, Galbraith!
Then you found the leopard --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
Why did you give up teaching?
That was unfortunate.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Are you all right?
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
I know. Funerals.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Thats right.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
You... You found that at Leons?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
Mr Lombard...
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Is there anything to understand?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
You splendid bastard...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
I know where to look.
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Have we done business before?
Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!
I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Recommended?
Okay. Recommended...
You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
What is?
What are you talking about?
Five to three. Youre early.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
... No.
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Excuse me?
What about which girlfriend?
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matine.
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Very funny. Can I go on now?
That's a good idea, sire.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Now?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Tell me...
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
And?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
W-w-what are you doing?!
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Am I... am I dead?
How old are you?
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
... You look wonderful...
So how would you put it?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
My captains have sworn their support.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Wait, wait...
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
The clothes are not important...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
I don't know... I thought...
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
My... visions...
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
Beautiful.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
What did I tell you?
Funny time to say this.
Tough luck.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, please.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Cow!
How long have you been here?
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
What the hell are you doing?
What's your work?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Careful! Watch his hand.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
There is something to be said for silence
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
What for?
The piano.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He chopped it off
She says, throw the piano overboard.
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
What do we do?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
You're late.  Where you been?
You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
I thought you blew all your money.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.
They're still looking for him.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
It was too noisy.
Then why you doin' it?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
How ya doin'?
See and raise five.
The name is Lonnegan.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
What time you get off work here?
2:00 A.M.
You move right along, don't ya.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
All right, when?
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Said he stole his invention.
Oh, Andy.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Give it to me.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
I didn't.
You hand that over to the police.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
tried him once -
She... she fell over backwards.
Hello, Dorothy. 
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
How's your brother?
I know -- I know --
Only in bad weather.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Did you kill her?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
Did you go?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
I think we may as well sit down.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
What did you do with the rest?
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Did you get my money?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
I see.  I see.
No word at all?
Well, don't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Pretty girl.
Who's that?
Isn't that my drink?
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
That's jolly.
I'd like to see you work.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
There's one coming.
You're a fine watch dog.
I never saw that before.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
What do you mean?
It was his body that was buried there.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
I'm going to tell her.
Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?
Who do you think did it?
Yes.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I just wanted to tell you...
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Paper.
What's it say?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
They shouldn't have been here.
What are you doing.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Epps!
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You said he was a deserter.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
I out rank you, that's why.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Wes--
So you can give us away?
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
What!?  What!?
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
You can't tell anybody about this.
It'd make their heads explode.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
You didn't step on any mine.
Just be cool.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
Must be a compartment.
Is it dead?
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
We'll find our way.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Epps?
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
And then what?
And then shoot them.
Shi'ites, I think.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Well?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
What?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
If!  If there's a treasure.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
Yeah!  Yeah!
Yeah, well, we're not.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
It's got a bottom.
What the hell are you doing!?
I think he wants something to drink.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
I can't hear him.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
What happened?
I have to... he's a G-34
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I've never been under the table before.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
You don't know.  You don't....
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Are you all right?
They don't know.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
There goes another of your disciples.
Who?  Who's leaving?
THX and me.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Not very encouraging.
What?
What's going on?
Right now.
Maternity ward, huhh!
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
She's not there
No......  She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
What do you want?
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
May I help you?
Hey, that's the guy-
Coffee, Mike?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Right.
Why do you do it?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Would you?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Which one's which?
Computer device?
Alex-
Why are we stopping here?
Alex, please-
What the hell's going on?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
He is!
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Mike...
Don't talk.
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
What?
What's this?
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I know.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Well, have you found it?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
No!
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
No.
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
You're looking fine, Major.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Smart. London, eh?
He's really not a bad fellow.
Yes, Baron?
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What is it?
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Seven and nine!
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
yse seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Yes.
Yes.
You like that statue?
Not particularly.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Too much blue in crimson.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
I'll be delighted.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Then a little nap--
Good night. 
Yes, I would!
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I <u>must</u> go.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Yes, madame?
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
He started it.
No--I'm sorry.
The pumps --
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
The ship will sink.
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Shit.
Don't drop it Rose.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
An accident?!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
But I was with him the whole time.
Is this in any way unclear?
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
You're crazy.
HELP! HELP!!
Well, here you are.
If only it were that simple.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Jack, must you go?
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
You're trembling.
It's so cold.
Yes sir.
Is your stateroom alright?
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Rose, get in the boat!
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Oh--a hundred times--
Feeling a little better, I see.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Isn't she lovely?
You'll excuse me. 
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
I'll say she is!
I could stand some more--
So you washed it off!
There's soft music--
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Married?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Thanks.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
We coulda got two third-class!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
My change.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
You take some awful chances.
Where did you hide it?
It's your deal.
I thought you were a sucker--
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Care to join us?
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Hello, young fellow!
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
What's that?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Yes--Me--in person!
Hello, Denby!
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Yes.
What do you mean?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
What's he got that I haven't got?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
He's all right.
Why?
Congratulations.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
I was in his cabin--
I'll explain later--
God damn son of a...
Nice voice.
Beauty, ain't he?
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Forget it.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Satisfied?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
You really look awful.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Good God, you're really-
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
What is it?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Just answer.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
I didn't mean it that way.
What can I get you?
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
No really, I can stay a while.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
Mattie.  What about this?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
That what you got me up here for?
'Least they don't scare women.
But this time they'll be ready.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Yeah?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
I'm sorry.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
- Four wheel drive?
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I got you covered.
They point, I shoot.
Three. You? Married?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Have we met?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Nice to run into you again.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No?
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He's killed closer.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
... What's Harmsway done?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
Stop it!
I am. What do you want?
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
He brought that up from the wreck.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Like a veil has been lifted?
Do you think you won?
Who is it?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
What for?
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
Let me get you a cup?
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
What are you doing?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Where is Skip?
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Yeah?!
Next stop...
Where was the last place you left him?
Woody!  Buzz!
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Sure is a hairy fellah.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Hold on, Woody!
Ha-ha!!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hi!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
W-w-w-we?
No, Slink --
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Woody?!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
But you're Irish!
I like plaits.
Who's there?
Reprieve.
Everything is gone, now.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
I don't know what you mean.
I... I don't really know.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
How long have you known?
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Not yet.
Is this bad for him?
What's up?
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Live with your parents?
Yes.
I'm third in my class.
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
She ain't in on it.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
Depends on the state.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
I don't know, sir.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Somewhere safe.
An informant.
Does this offer include my partner?
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega is a criminal.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
What do you mean?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
OK. Same again?
It's a scandal, Franco.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.
I'd fucking kill you.
Diane.
It's where I live.
What?
Come on.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Well, it isn't.
Happy birthday.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
Following the game at all?
Aye.
Thanks, Mark.
Cheers.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Exactly.
Another dab?
Running time?
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
So who else?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
Well, it's up to you.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
Sounds great, Swanney.
This had better be good.
It's fresh air.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
A walk.
Homeless people?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
The power was within you.
But how?
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
Because it's there.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Yes, Captain.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Your vision?
You are mad!


Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
Spock?
I cannot go with you.
I belong here.
You did break in.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Dillinger?
Did you say Group 7 access?
You call that getting over it?
Beautiful!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Yeah...?
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
That all you can say?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
If you think -
That was uncalled-for.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Flynn!!
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Hey... !
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Where are you going?
You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.
Yeah, right.
You're kidding.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Just hang a minute.
Guy's a spook!
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I thought this look like your work.
But you didn't.  Why not?
No!  Never!
My husband is a good man.
Yes what?
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Yes.
I think so.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
You working on someone right now?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Beat it.
What's going on, Harry?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
What do you want me to do?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The forager's back.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Tell me about yourself.
What kinda music do you like?
Turn-offs?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
You have a pimp?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Cancoon.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Yeah.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
I'm her husband.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
Elliot Blitzer.
Where?
Two guys.
Yeah?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
What department?
He wants to talk ya.
Elliot.
Yeah?
Say it, goddamn it!
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
No. No you're not.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I got some money I can give you -
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
Where'd you come from?
We talked him into it.
Not a tiny little vial -
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
How the fuck could he know?
Rock whores.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Put it in your pants.
No.
Do you know a Clarence Worley?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
We want you to tell us about last night.
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
What's she doing?
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
And your only goal is...???
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
The gun! ... I lost it
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
I'm not crazy.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
It's private.
What....???
You do know me.  You helped me once.
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You can't do that yourself?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Maybe I do.
What do you want for free?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
It's nonsense.
Out of here.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
You Harlin?
You own this place?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Accident.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Let me get your change.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
Jake, what is that?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You sure you can manage?
It's nothing.  Really.
Thank you, John.
You're not from around here, are you?
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
What?
Games?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You just walk away.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Where?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
Where are you going?
To get my car.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
John . . .?
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
I think I busted my leg.
What for?
What happened to your hand?
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
Live there?
Wait a second--
Hey!
Just ran into a little trouble.
Nice office you've got.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
I do.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
I need thirteen.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Yeah, well, me too.
Liar.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
But you was going to fight for me.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You're fucked.
Christ, I don't believe this.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Eh?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Maybe I do.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Yeah...
That's a solid name.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Wait a second--
Like you don't know.
How do you know if you've never tried?
You're talking like a madman.
It's the truth, Jake.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Oz.
But he's dead.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
What you want?
Got any cold soda?
Eh?
It's Grace.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Stop it.
Grace ... Grace?
Anywhere?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
But, in particular?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
They look nice.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Yes. Is this David?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
What's he talking about?
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
Like what?
Yes.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
That's great.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Not really.
Where were you sitting on the train?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Where'd you get the money, huh?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
He tell you where them others is?
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Mmmm pistols.
Yeah?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Ned's share?
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Maybe I ain't.
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
She's passed on, Kid.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
First one I ever killed.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Well, she...
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
What is it, son?
Hullo, paw.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Say, Ned... ?
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
They ruined me tonight.
That's enough, Edie.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
You heard right.
County. I was in for fraud.
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Get out.
What fence? Who?
You okay?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
A little of both.
We want to meet him.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
When does he post bail?
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
Waste of time.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
I don't know about that.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
Then what?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
How good's your intelligence?
You thought it was just.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
It looks that way.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
We went to Code Blue...
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Objection, we've...
Objection!
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
I'm just an M.D.
Through, through his book.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
Thank you for seeing me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Hello, I'm calling from...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Kathy Price.
Why?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Is there going to be a later...?
Not if you don't grow up...
He's not in, Sir.
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
You got a good memory, Franky.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
That's right.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
...four years ago...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Mrs...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
He won't talk.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
I want you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
What for? Who are you?
About three years.
Because I remind you of her?
An hour?
No.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
You want me to dress like her?
You don't even want to touch me.
Ah, no!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I'm scared.
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Yes!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
What are you going to do?
Some money.
I loved you, Madeleine.
You don't remember.
Where had you been before?
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Meet again, sometime.
I don't know.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
No birds live here.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Here with you.
Would you know the room?
I'm here, I've got you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Where's your husband?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Where?
Let me go into the church alone.
Is there something I can do for you?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Does she sleep here? Ever?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
More than you think.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
It's where you belong.
From that music.
I've never run across one like that.
How's your love life, Midge?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Pop Leibel.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Do you know him well?
Here you are.
Around.
What I've been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Can't do what?
First of all...
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
Why?
I'm calling the police.
We've already done this.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
What?
There is no candy!
Are you solid with that?
I know and I'm honored...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
What is it?
But not tonight.
We need padded chairs.
I'm calling the police.
Easy Boyd.
He's cracked up.
What you just said. Say it again.
Yeah.
That's right.
My what?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
You're sick.
Not a prayer.
The hell I did!
Nope.
False.
True.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
What's your point?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
May we have the rings please?
What?
This is ridiculous.
Florist?
Caterer?
Yes.
I think I forgot the tent.
I think so.
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Right before the wedding?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
How much?
Seating problems.
So what do we do?
I need your help.
Nesting?
Yeah. Sure.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
But...
No...
The wahoo moment?
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
What is it?
Greenpeace.
You alright?
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
We will.
Shut up Micheal.
Give them to Refugio.
Two.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
Don Amalio!
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
Yes, it is.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
He was asking for it.
I don't know, sir.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
What do you know about me?
Leave him alone.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Don't say that.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
When you are, miss.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
What about you, Manuel?
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
What did you find out?
Enough to level an entire city block.
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
HEY!!!
I haven't been working on anything.
This is supposed to be years away.
I wonder how that...
It was me, what?
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
That's not true, Parker.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
She's beautiful, you know?
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't get out of the car.
Enjoying yourself?
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
See something?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
It's the White House.
What about it?
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
What rig?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Who we got here...?
It won't hold.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
<u>Do</u> it...
Twenty thousand dollars.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Yes
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...where is the Back End coming from?
In the yellow ribbon.
Eight Days To Go 
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Get on this, right now...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
What are we going to do?
Oh, Lord....
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
"...where's my pill..."
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
Whaddaya think?
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
When's he coming back...?
Do I know you?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
...going to War...
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Because.
I'm sure they do.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
"Back End" ... count on it.
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Big mistake.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
A proud tradition.
Don't tune it too good.
Keep Talking....
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
A beret.
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Sell?
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
About what?
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
What if they call him?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
So, where are we going?
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Okay.
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
My home number's on the back...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
Know the name?
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
How much?
What makes you think you can?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Gordon.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Excuse me.
So. See you Friday.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Would you like a closer look?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Can I give her a message?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Come on.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
I'll come back all the time.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
That's not true.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Fireball?
How do you know it's a she?
How?
Yes, but...
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
You were in an accident?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who?
Um...yes.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Would you like some iced tea?
Your house is so beautiful.
What?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Yeah.
How you holding up?
Jody--
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
I think so
What?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Did you call the police?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Get down!  He'll see.
He killed her.
See?
What are you doing?
What are you...?  No.
Do I have everything?
You know I am.
We walked all night...
What's the matter?
"You know..."
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Oh God...
What?
She can't be here without me.
What's that for?
Nothing.
Mmmuh...
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Stop it!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Parents say he - uh - fell -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Lie...?
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Made it...?
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
What about your work back home...?
Ro, how long have we known each other.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You did that, didn't you...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
What were you talking about...?
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
You can't just -
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I heard something like that
I thought you were someone else
All the time?
No - not all the time - I mean
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
What are you doing?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
So what do you do?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
No she didn't...
I don't know...
How long have you been watching me?
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What is it?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
What happened?
At home alone - where were you?
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
ANGEL...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
See? Did you see that?
Who the hell was your father?
Cut it out, before you break something!
What is it now?
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
You're late, bro!
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
You got everything you ever wanted.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Well. The prom's coming up.
So that's a maybe?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
Yeah.
Finally, some gratitude.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
I-I don't have the keys.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Who exactly ARE you?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
You're on the next plane home.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
My new bike.
It's not up to me.
I didn't forget.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Why can't you be nice to me?
He didn't. He had it built.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Take your time.
I understand.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
About a year ago.
What about witnesses?
Just tell us what happened.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Ms. Toller?
I said he did.
Thank you, Jimmy.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Okay, what's the matter?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
I miss Dad.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
I'm here.
Hello.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Good thinking.
Forget it.
Who is it?
Where is she?
No.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
That was about as grim as it gets.
What?
What's wrong?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
We?
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
J. S. Bach.
Funny.  So am I.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
But don't pull that again.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Now, what was that?
Know what this is?
Oh, damn!  That's it.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Relax.  We're almost there.
God in heaven, what is that?!
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Yes sir.
He had a pressing engagement.
That would be... the Mexican War?
The first.
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
Who was this partner of his?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Not today, Willow.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Farmer.
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Dada, what's a daikini?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
You must learn magic.
What'd you bit me for!!
Why?
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Who is he?
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?
John, why?...
I thought I was the English.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
I saw him.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Don't let them hurt you.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
So one of them got to him.
Maybe.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
What's your first move?
We do not go into your courts.
Oh? Anything else?
What?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Your husband's?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
You know where he is.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
God, Fred...
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
No, Rachel...
Never seen anything like that in all my years.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
No, you listen. Get out!
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Who are you?
I don't believe you!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
Are you all right, Dorothy?
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Toto, too.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
No --
And him a brain.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Dorothy!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
A home --
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Did they hurtcha?
They're coming back!
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
I have so got brains.
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
Where's Kansas?
Um-hmm.
Here -- here --
Real courage. That's what we want.
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Here --   Come on.
Yes, you.
Up!
Where -- where do we go now?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Where do we go now?
...Tin Man!
No, sir!
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh - look out.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Yeah --
Then its no longer a bomb?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Nuclear.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Do you know what youre doing?
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Perhaps after this ... test?
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
The inside man?
The name?
Who is he?
No!  It will cave in!
I cant stay.
Then take me with you.
How did you survive?
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I could have given you the world.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
I thought you were the one in her business.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Now...where were we?
Wheres the sub going?!
No! Bond!
What class sub does your nephew run?
Warm.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?
Why?  What's the problem?
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
A whore fucking.
Blake?  Dead?
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
I won't do that.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What??
And what if youre wrong?
What if youre wrong??
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
His what?
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
So do I.  So do you.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I'm terribly sorry.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
What do I get out of it?
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Is that all?
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Where are you going?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
When can I see you again?
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I'm through, Xander.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
Are you all right?
Jean... can you?
Logan, do you see this ring?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
What is it you intend to do to me?
Where am I?
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Where are we going?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Give him an extra dollar.
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
What in God's name are you doing?
Baack!
MMMmm!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Yes, don't worry.
I promise.
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
You're incorrigible!
What a strange fellow.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
Yes!... the laboratory.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Dr. Frankenstein?
Why did you do that?
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
A piece of what?
But, sir...
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Frederick Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
There.
There wolf!  There castle!
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
Just putting up some tea.
Did you hear that strange music??
Could be worse!
You can't win 'em all.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Don't fall for that one.
Original.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
How's it going?
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's the only way.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
What's that tune that you're playing
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Well, this explains the music.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
