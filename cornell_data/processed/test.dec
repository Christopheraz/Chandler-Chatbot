Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Cameron.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Tons
Who?
Joey.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Exactly my point
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
It's her favorite band.
Yeah -- we'll see.
A hundred bucks a date.
Get her to act like a human
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
That's never been proven
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You know who The Raincoats are?
BIANCA
Unwelcome.
What?
No one else knows
What?
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
We're your guys.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Dr. Ruth?
That's something you can't decide.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Yes... I remember...
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Then you are too ambitious.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
... and also to bring medicine.
That she was impregnable.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
And what do you think Mendez?
We can't be.
Immediately.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Oh, sure.
What about Oleg?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Yes, but he was a cop.
Divorced.
So you were never a prostitute?
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
In the kitchen.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Who do you think, Chief?!
I let her take a shower.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
What was that, Korfin?
Any I.D.?
Yeah.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
My folks are.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I kill someone famous.
Yeah.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
I love you.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
Dog food.
Get down on your knees.
Where's Czech girl?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Yes sir.
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Don't speak Russian!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Shut up.
I did.
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
No, I don't get that!
You want the tape?  There it is!
What are you coming here to do?
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
I used an accelerant.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Right. Just a sec.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
No. I never did, either.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
Yes, I thought so.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Did they have any explanation for this?
I'll bet it's a fortune.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Certainly.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
That's true.
Roger.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I never paid for it in my life.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
You're done.  End of story.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
He's after your money.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
No way...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
Don't worry about it.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
You couldn't get to him?
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Doesn't look like it.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
What'd you do?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
No wonder you're so popular.
Just a second, that's all!
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
What do you want?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Sure, right.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Five.  On credit.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Found it?
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
...Like love...
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Actually only one cell survived..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Got it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
Why the gun?
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
... What's going on?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
A fellow investor.
I want to watch you work.
Machine.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Machine's in?
You betrayed us.
I figured you share information.
We do.
I'm not so sure about this.
How'd you find me here?
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Because we're going there.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Shut up.
I'm asking.
I'll risk it.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Just curious.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
How are you?  Having any luck?
How will I get it to you?
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes, but...
She just seemed... depressed... ?
What was she running from?
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It got to be too much for him.
I didn't mean to...
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
What?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
I don't want to.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Then we'll stay up together.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
"In her dream"?
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
It was Freddy.
So?
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
There you go.  Love you.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
No.  A deal's a deal.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Now.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
So did Dan.
Well we gotta do something!
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
My baby!
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
My father!  He's not - ?
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
I guess.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
'Us?'
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
I...don't know!
Something wrong?
What????
Radiation level...constantly rising...
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
Huh?
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
That's what I said!
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Why?
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Always has been.
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Yeah.
They said.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
What blood?
Sure you did.
Saw him do it?
Do what?
Yes.
It belongs to Pop.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
You're a policeman.
Where's the plow?
You don't want the extra police pay?
I figured you already heard.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
I won't. You interested?
Could be.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
I'm sorry.
What way?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Can --?
Hold on!
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Jack?
Nothing.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Who?
Yeah. I forgot.
I don't know. You tell me.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Well, I never heard that one.
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
To swear you in as President.
Why?
My loyalty was never to my country.
Nine.
Where are we now?
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Scared. We're scared.
Yes
That was war.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
One thing I've learned as
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
They've gotta be joking.
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
Please... don't start with me.
We're under attack.
This is the President.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Yes I did...
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted!
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Yes, sir.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
What...?
Sixteen 'C', why?
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
I can't tell.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Certainly.
Well...
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
And a little ice!
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Yeah...
That's right.
Show me.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
I am George.
Back off, George.
I'll handle it.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
My wife?  She worries about me.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Thank you.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
What's that?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
You?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Would you, Sir?
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
If I go.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
Forget it.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
...We're coming in.
Do it!
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Seal the door.
Terrible.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Gone.
Good morning.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
How do you know?
In a harem.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Humiliated?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Of course.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
I love you! I love you!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Why?
Give me two more weeks. Please.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
What for?
What?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
I was at hand.
In three months! Papa.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Well. There it is.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
I will.
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Good morning, sir.
In there, sir.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Are you Herr Mozart?
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Wolfi!
Yes.
Can I see it?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
My answer is no, Mozart.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
What dead? Who is dead?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I do.
Who?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
We ended in F Major?
What time?
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Please! Just one moment.
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Certainly, Herr Director.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
On the contrary.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
Yes?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Where?
Ah.
What? Who the devil are you?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Thank you.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
What?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Right.
Will you give me a break?
I'm twenty-seven.
Yes, go on.
What?
Will you think about it?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I would think so.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
Don't you remember?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
No what?
I looked.
Has he been refusing food?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
You're in a hospital in London.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
She says she 'likes me too much'.
Nice to see you.
I heard that.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Plan?
Do you think it's a dog?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Are you going to help me up?
What?!
I'm not listening!
Will you be quiet?!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Jack, are you really dead?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Let me have ten bucks?
Charlie!
Yeah?
And tell him not to delay.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Get out, get out!
know, but
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Yes, sir.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Thank you!
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
I don't know.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why - well, I
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
But I haven't . . .
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
What are you talking about?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
There you are!
wasn't anywhere near this place
Yes.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Nope.
The Army can hang him.
Tomorrow.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Exactly.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
I could use the walk.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
What is wrong with you?
Sorry.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Missed you too, cousin.
Which one, right or left?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
It's a secret.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
That would have made an impression.
You are a charmer.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Ma.
Don't care.
Bob's upset.
No, I --
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Say your prayers?
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
What?
Not if I find the right girl.
Yep.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
If you don't see it, it's not real...
And the same age Web was. No.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Yes sir.
What is that?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Take it off.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You just haven't been looking.
I don't think so.
Really?
We should do it.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
He's rich.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
No, you...didn't?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
After six.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
No. Flattering, but no.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Why would I?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
You seem...nervous.
Actually, yes.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
So...you hang out here a lot?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Well, I could he wrong.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Marcus?
Yes.
I'm hungry.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
It's...it's...all right.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
...What?
Right. Wait. A toast.
I don't think he knows how.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Nothing!
Were the flags for Teddy?
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Wait... He knows.
I'm calling Gary.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
You're compulsive.
Then and now.  But not right now.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
You mean -- break in?
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
But you said the other --
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
I didn't plan this.
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
We're too late. Take a look.
Behave!
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Hey, how are you?
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Carnies.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Yes Basil?
Be careful!
Good on ya, man.
I'm sorry?
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
I am not.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Are you crazy?
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Danger's my middle name.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
What are you saying, son?
Shut up.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
What about his teeth?
And how do you feel about that?
There are limits?
Love...
Fear ...
Eh? In here!
After the cold war ...
To you ... ?
To find out who killed my husband.
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
I'm already married ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
For a man in my position --
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
An eccentric recluse?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
... and now?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Amnesia?
Insane ... ?
I feel sure of it.
Rules are made to be broken.
...Really?
What do you mean?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You're kidding.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
Women!
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Maybe it had something to do.
Fine. How's everything going?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Yes, sir.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I love you.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Great, Mom.
I hope those guys are all right.
Any time, Al.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
What are you...
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
You're a pimp?
I'll take some.
What do you mean, it changes?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
It's Bullwinkle.
Can't I just maim it a little?
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
No, Brett, I...
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Olivier's in that, right?
I'm proud of you, lad.
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
You got it.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
It's comin' along... want a beer?
Yeah? What about Laura --
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Fuck you.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I'll handle it.
You look great.
Really? No kidding.
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Got anything to drink in there?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Then why did you quit?
Yes.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Then who --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Trychticholorate.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
Did I say thanks?
No.
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Firehouse.
He just wants to --
I'll be there.
He's got piano lessons.
Okay.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
And old ladies?
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Well you did.
Give me some?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Delacroix.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We was coming to see you.
You have to start getting into your character.
I won't do it anymore.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
This has to be a big mistake.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Is that so?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Sounds risky to me.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Work related or otherwise?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
In time.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
What's a Negro.
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a...
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like grits and butter...
...like fried and chicken...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
I know I won't be your puppet.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
How do you do, sir?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
The coward!
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
I don't know!
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
I'm not telling you what happened.
You wanna bet?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Would you have believed me?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Why?
If not you, then who?
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Full clip to the body --
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Why?
Not the happiest of memories?
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
What happened next?
Are you sure?
Nah.
No.
Get in.
Tough.
Yeah.
But you didn't see it, right?
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
Childs.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
I used it to start the fire --
Shut up!
Sir, yes, sir!
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
The poet? What ever happened to him?
So I've heard.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Well, it's not a short one.
You were talking about your wedding.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
They're your favorite flower.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
That's because most of it never happened.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
He's up with your father.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
That's okay?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
You can see why it's sensitive?
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Yes.
Sorry?
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Have you got your passport?
It's none of your business.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Excuse me?
Sometimes neither.
So now you hate all women?
You didn't mind too much.
You are throwing me out.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
What was her name?
What's your name?
It's alright.
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Oh! Gave me a start.
That'd be nice.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
You ain't the kicker, are you?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
I got others.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Why you got me chained?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
To freedom.
I'm here with you.
By myself?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Maybe I won't.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Now, hold up.
He tapped that.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
This all looks wonderful.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Why she got a chain on her?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
Yeah, I know.
I just wanted some make-up.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Home.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Why?
Maybe we should do something?
Saving your life.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Cool?
Connie...
If you give me one.
Where would you look for the mafia?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Yeah...
Nick...
Good.  Very good...
I'll check it out.
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
Luck.
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
I paid for that.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
What do you chant?
Who am I supposed to be?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
What?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
The families who control the casinos?
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
Pris?
Anywhere.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
But not to last.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
You're just all so... so different.
Dr. Tyrell?
Industrial refuse.
Why, yes, of course.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Longevity is classified.  No.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Meaning?
But if you could?
What night?
What shows?
You mean the snake.
Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
And who do I go to about you?
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
I'm sorry.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Sorry.
I'm tired of this.
What one?
What desert?
Know what a turtle is?
Really?
Sure.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Over this?
I know a short-cut.
Okay.
What?
Why not go to work for me?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
Night!
Oh, I'm sure it will!
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
It does?
Yes, ma'am!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Wow.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Good-bye!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
How do I leave here?
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
No kidding!
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Really?  Since when?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
That would knock my father out.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
I just don't want to.
I LOVE THIS!!
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Goodbye.
You don't look thirty-five.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
I'll be all right.
What?
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Really?
It's safe.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Why?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
I don't believe it!
--do as I say!
Oh, yes.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I see "elegant."
That's what I'm sensing.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Yes, you do.
What?
And if we can't find him?
Yeah! That's thinking.
To get some frozen poultry.
We came back to the house!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Come on.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Buy it from me?
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Only you and the photo lab.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Nobody.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
No.
See my nipples?
Yes, I like you.
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
No.
Yes.
No police!!!  No police!!
Yes.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
What?
You look beautiful to me.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Speak to me Fucker.
What?
Yes.
What kinda beer do you like?
Be right down.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Yeah?
Nothing. I'm fine.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Alright.
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
It's good to see you, Dad.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
Terrible boring.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
You didn't tell him about me?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You look beautiful.
No.
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
We're here brother.
Well, I didn't but...
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
How many?
Shut it. It's Ma.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
For what?
I don't know they just always need it.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
How do you figure?
Pee...Per...Man.
Why was I not informed of this?
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Shit! Shit!
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
We promise.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You believe?
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
I believe these young men are right.
Yes.
Yeah boss?
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Yeah, I saw it.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Maybe he just went to the store.
That's a long time to be in jail.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
OK.
Can you hand me those french fries.
What?
Ah. Couple days ago.
I don't think you will.
Any activity?
I don't know.
Let's go. Come on.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
How?
That's a sharp jacket.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
It feels good.
I don't want to die.
Death.
It's an esoteric journey.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Yeah. He said that.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Sixty days?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Dies y nueve.
Feel this.
Bob! Get back in position!
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Good question.
OK.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That could be anybody's.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Come on, Dignan.
Yes, I do.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Anthony. Bad news.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Take him to the car, Bob.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Wait a second --
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Is that your chiquita?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
It's locked.
What?
Anything else?
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Don't you want answers?
Did he say anything to you?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
Sorry. Old habits.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
But it ends up the same.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I did.
You do?
I want to hear it from you.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
I want someone I know to take me in.
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
Now. Show now.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Amnesia?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
That depends on the man.
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
A common thief.
A patriot!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Thank you for accepting.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Okay.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
You know my father?
I thought you were a December baby.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
It was a long time ago.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
Go on. Sit down.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
And...?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
Who -- who are you?
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Wow... read something.
What's wrong with you?!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Huh?
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
I came with Captain Renault.
What is your name?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Practically no one.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Well, so long.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
He suggested I ask you.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
My office.
Right.
I beg your pardon?
My wife?
Thank you.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Thank you.
Are you quite finished with us?
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Mademoiselle.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
Perhaps not.
Yeah? What's his name?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
His escape.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
I'm a drunkard.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Not right now.
No.
No. Not me, boss.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yeah, boss?
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Worse than Warsaw.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Feels so good to lie here.
No water, no work.
Going to die anyway.
No.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Shut up.
No.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Had a package to deliver.
Cold.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
I have to.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
I know.
My epitaph.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
It means a lot...that you came.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Yeah.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
You fucked us over.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Believe me I know.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
Where's Mandalay?
I understand.
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Just a little privacy.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Well, they aren't.
That's true.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
A B-24 Liberator.
It's all very normal.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I haven't read that.
It's my turn!
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
You do it then.
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Silicon Valley?
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
It's not true.
Mob?
Tonight. Just me.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You sure?
I have a good crew.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Great. Thank you.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
I gotta go get a haircut.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Good point.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
I'm sorry.
I'll find the time.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
What?
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
Let's just say he burned me once.
What do you want?
Roger that.
I can imagine.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
Sorry.
That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I won't be that long.
I've got something to tell you.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Tension. It'll go.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You will?
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Nothing about you.
Then what?
What?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
First visit to London?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
I don't gamble.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
It won't.
What about my neck?
Did you solve your problems?
You did?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Have I?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
I'm not going to report it.
And the girls?
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Why four? And not three or five?
Wipe your hands.
What for?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Yes.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Energy shielding positive function.
And I saw that I was alone.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
That is correct.
Yes, well...
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
Guess again.
Yeah?
That's a lotta crap.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
No.
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
Could you give us a moment.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I got overhead...
They took my daughter.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
The one you're wearing?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Yeah...
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
The other one like you...
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Look, thank you for this but--
I need to talk to her.
Okay, okay.
Right here someplace.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
How long you and me known each other?
It's a secret.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
And because he's my friend.
Please...
So are dogs.
A toy?
What happens if you level with her?
And why should she?
She tells you how I've been--
--a philandering pig.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
More like deployed in bed asleep.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
It's okay.
Believe it.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
What's it worth to you?
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
One more time in English.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Tickets?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Hawk?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
What do you want?
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Are you AFRAID?
Did you know him?
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
So... that's it?
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Donnie! Give it back!
Where did you come from?
You have a request?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Sure.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
Are you okay?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
Yeah...
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
How so?
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Follow him where?
Yes.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Yes.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
I think now that he might...
Frank is going to kill.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Yeah.
What's her name?
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
She's right over there.
Yeah, you betcha...
You-betcha.
Thank God for bunge cords.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Yah?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
You heard me. Where is it?
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Ohio...
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
That's enough!
Nothin' too showy!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
He should be king!
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
His Excellency's car!
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Take a letter...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's not bad for any day.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
THEN IT'S WAR!
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Why -- why -- of course.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
And here are my mother and father.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Did you see it?
I'll get my bag.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
Well, yes.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Please do.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Romance!
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Of course! You want out?
Yyess.
Yes.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Here.
Yes.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Oh no, I couldn't.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There IS no one.
Those things in your hands.
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It was different...
We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
Erik. You don't understand.
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Not quite...
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
Well, how d'you think I feel?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Why... should YOU care?
Tell me your name?
What a stupid idea.
No.
What's it all about?
Who have you been talking to?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Sorry.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
How about making friends?
That's it!
She knows it was our fault!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Yes, Mum.
Okay, I guess.
In the room?
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Why?
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Huckleberry Hound?
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
You just say. I'm not really --
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
That's scary sounding.
You'll call me, right?
Oh?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Naomi, I guess.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Hi.
Yeah, like that.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
What if you stay this time?
What if?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I probably got the same thing as you.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Yeah. Cool.
That's a good one.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
You love him, don't you?
I don't know! I just said that!
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Nothing.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Well, thank you, Mary.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
I have a family, Mary.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Maybe after the holidays then.
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
You mean she's dead?
What is Debbie's position?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Like what?
Whose fault was that?
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
What guy?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Hold on, Coop...
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Roger that.
Coffee.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
He's crashing...
What's on your mind?
Some things you don't get over.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
From the Other Place...
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Frozen.
Do it.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
If it worked.
It's 2041...
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Where has it been for the past seven years?
It's done.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
They're gone.
What is it, Smith?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Let's go.
We're all here.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Blow it up?
They're explosive charges.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
It's easy for you to be patient.
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Where do you think? With Sue.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Ben. Are you okay?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
But all these people...
Johnny.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Yes, thanks.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Sue... look at your hands.
That's what we're here to find out.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
You need a doctor.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben did this.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
They were left over from the last shift.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Oh, really?
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Get a ride with somebody.
What a guy.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Ace the jacket.
Damone. It's Mark.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
I thought he was out of town.
All right.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Really?
What's the big deal?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I think they're both virgins.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
What do you want?
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
What's that?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
You're gonna flunk me?!
I know, everyone says that.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
No. I mean back to your home.
Excellent.
Not at all.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
What limes?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Yes!
Yeah.
Come on, come on.
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
And the head?
Hey!
There's a tunnel.
Follow me.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Just an observation.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Really?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Huh?
Is it gassed up?
How many?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
Whoa!
What?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Move slow and move quiet.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Well...
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
What're you doing?
'Forgive'...? For What?
I guess so, sir.
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
Who is she?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Were you a drug addict?
Thanks, Dad.
He's a socialist, then?
...Then go.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Thank you.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Don't touch me.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Yeah, well --
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Eight stories.
You're telling me.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I should've known...
I guess.
To quarter-horses.
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Why do you say that?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
Mama...?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I'm going out!
Excuse me.
What?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
You what?
Yeah?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
People can be kinder than you think.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
Your decision. For us.
Victor. I love you,
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
Now husband and wife.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Oh God.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
They'll hang him all the same.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
That's blasphemy!
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
I'm... dying.
Who are you?
My name is Frankenstein...
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I was careless.
I guess...
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Sure.
I finished the boats.
I don't know.
I'll go take a look.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
Where'd you get that stuff?
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
I love you.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Just my son and I.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Twenty-eight.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
My wife.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Why not, against your religion?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Scott?
No!
Sure.
Mexicans.
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Yes.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I wasn't scratching!
You callin' him a liar?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Gotcha!
No.
Do they have a waterbed?
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
She's in the other room.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Yeah, it's mine.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
None at this time, sir.
Didn't take long.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
Pardon?
No, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Fuck me.
I'll act surprised.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
What changed?
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
You'll think about my offer?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
No, ma'am.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
I oughtta report you.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
She's haze grey and underway...
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Yeah.  Me too.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
They had to kill 'em?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
I think you look beautiful.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
We are so fucked.
The first female President?
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Great. See ya then.
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
What?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Oh yes he will.
The JFK? In the rain!?
Yeah, well...
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
You're kidding, right?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Not now. You got my bag?
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
That is when we will go in.
And how should we do that, Sir?
It's Tatopoulos.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Follow me.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
We've met before.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Makes us look more American.
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
It's Raymond.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
...Damn you!  Damn you!
Like YOU know?
Yes. Good was done this .....
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
Okay, now. But-
That's It?
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
It's suicide.
Something BAD happened here.
All right. Put me back on with him.
Yeah, what is it?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
Well... Sort of...
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Push It. Hold it down.
Oh god...
Tommy, we have these...
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Find them.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Is that a fact.
It is.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Yes, general?
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
We better, Congress invented him.
Yes, I believe so.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
We already have black soldiers in our army...
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
Surely you knew this was coming.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
To win this war I need an army.
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
That's good... who?
That land belongs to the strongest.
Just because they are born?
Who says so?
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
No. What's this?
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Not too bad.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You just did.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
Maybe a few times I have.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
"Mr. Lovejoy".
You're kidding, right?
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
"Cotton".
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
Don't go out of your way.
Right. See how your story ends.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Really.
What happened?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Go get your stuff.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Hm?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
What? You sure?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Roger?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Or uninvited guests.
What're you crazy?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Sounds reasonable.
Threw a turbine blade.
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
Maybe you can tell me then.
You smashed it!
What?!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Then you're a lucky man.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Did you see him?
Epps.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
The what?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
I think I see it pretty well.
Of course they did.
You got that right.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
How's that?
Sorry.
We could call for help.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Say what?
Leave it.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Someone from the past.
God, how horrifying.
What is it now?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
You can count on me, sir!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Why?
That's just the way I am!
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
You loser.
What? Why?
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Did you sign up yet?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
That lets us off the hook.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
God, it's so totally pathetic.
What does that even mean?
What is this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
Fuck you!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
What does it stand for?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Totally! Look!
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What, is she black now?
Why don't you ask him.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
I don't believe you.
You won't believe it! Guess!
You're gross.  See that guy?
God, you're really obsessed...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
So should I come over?
What? When did you see Josh?!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
What time?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Indian records?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
I'm totally serious!
Jesus!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Oh yeah?
Oh, hi...
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...I better not...
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
I... I don't think so.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
I wish I could see him.
Yeah.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What are you talking about?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Do you have a check for me?
There is no reason for fear.
As are they all.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
How; we don't know where they are?
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Well, I need to speak to him.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
You never had it.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
So that's what a lion looks like. 
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Nonsense.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Not even close.  What happened?
Help finish the railroad.
Good night, Janosz.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
We don't have a relationship.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
I won't.
Thank you.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll supervise.
We definitely had a moment or two.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Or we could do that.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Let me jingle you right now.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Ghostbusters.
What are you doing up here?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Then why have you come?
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Did I forget something?
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
No, I just thought --
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
No.  They're just coming to me.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
It's in the stars.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
On a purely scientific basis.
Don't scream.
Really!  Is it gone?
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
We'll get back to you.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Die in what sense?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
In a storage facility.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
What have you got, Egon?
Yeah, I can smell it.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
But it's my favorite state.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
What do I say?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Who was the architect?
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Mmmhmmm.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
LATER, MAN!!
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
What is that... wailing?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
Gladly Caesar.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
Take grain away from the army?
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
That's what worries me...
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Servis made it through again?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I was summoned.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
I can see that...
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Then get a large cash advance.
Before they leave, get gold.
Was I?
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Hello.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
I'm glad.
You sure you really want to?
I've never been to it.
Yes.
-- really incredible --
What did she say?
Then what?
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Oh.
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
We just can.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
No, Benjamin.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Mr. McQuire.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
One of those outside agitators.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
I am going to call the police now.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Right.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
In general.
Will you take me home?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
No.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Sit down.
Her portrait?
But they would! Don't you see?
Oh. Hello. Hello.
A drink? Of course.
Do you want me to get it?
Well -- I don't know.
That's fine.
The number.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Either one will be fine.
This is all terribly wrong.
I got up.
I walk out.
Thank you.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
See if you can guess.
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
All right. Now let's get to bed.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Was he a law student at the time?
I don't think we were the first.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Good.
I wouldn't know.
I see.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
May I stay then?
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Where is Elaine?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Hey -- I don't get it.
When I go off?
No wait. Wait.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
-- worried?
What about it?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
I will.
You miss the point.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
I don't believe it.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Well?
No.
Have you got that skeleton key?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
Not with strangers.
Yes, I am rather.
That.
You're very funny --
Really?
Money.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You live here?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Just for a minute then.
I want to be alone.
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Good!
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
As you will.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Movies?
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Me.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
Definitely off.
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Exactly.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
No water -- What a place!
Then, it's all over?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Such nonsense.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know -- I know.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son was in the hospital --
You expect me to buy this?
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
You brought a case? Good.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I can't. I just left home.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
That's just Lilly's way.
Every day in every way.
We'll rent a car.
You ain't seen nothin.
Oh, come on, Roy.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Yeah? How?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
) What?
Yes?
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
No question, huh?
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
The cemetery...
I can be real stiff.
Carter.
It's Amy Kramer.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
I don't know.
John, you can't help her now.
John...
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
Here, take my jacket.
Still wants to move out?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
Can't you?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
You've been watching too much TV.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
I've come to help your family.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
Retiring.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
A bitch.
Must have changed that law.
You know what gets me?
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Haven't got one.
Huh.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
I dunno.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Maybe it's time you got out.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
Is Penelope in?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Our pleasure.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
You invited me.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Everybody says he was so brave.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
Oh hell.
Dad was never in England?
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Can I get dressed first?
Make it fast.
Leave a tip.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Dad--
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Have some.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
You used to like it stark!
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
No.
What then?
That's what you're supposed to say.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
If he thinks he's man enough.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
No.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
Do it, Norbert.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
And her fianc!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I've got to run!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
And terror, if you don't mind.
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open.  Find out.
The new hero is you.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
I dunno.  Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess.  Get a job in a motorcycle shop.  So long, you guys.
Yes.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
I don't want to live any more.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Oh, Paul--
What does he say to do?
Oh?
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Doing what?
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Yeah.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
What?
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
We met here earlier this evening.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Goodbye.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
But is she, has...
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
We offer...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
Ulcers.
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
At least I'm a growing person.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
But it's all you do.
He deals in pain.
What the crap?
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
...What do you have to offer?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
You are.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
No.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
The police? They know less than you do.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
What plan?
No.
You're talking about real excitement?
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Who?
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I don't know nothing, man.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
In other words, you want to get laid?
Sounds all right.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
What do you think of that? Or this?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
To anybody.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
No, no. I just took it.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Lady! Be quiet.
What kind of a car is it?
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Eh, no.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Oh, look! The birds.
All right.
Promise?
She seemed yare to me.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
What were you fighting for?
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Did Confucius say that?
Okay.
It's so blue.
With God?
Well, why don't you?
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Yes.
For you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
What about the draft?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
I don't know.
What else do you like?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Yes.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Another man's life in your sights.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Souvenirs?
Harold!
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
She certainly has.
You a doctor, too?
What do you mean?
Because I'm going to get my father!
I've come for my father!
And what about you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
What is it?
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Who wards off demons.
I worry about you.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
You're doing fine.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
His what??!!
I wish I could be more gracious but --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Red, I --
Good.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Doesn't sounds like him.
Strong.
I know.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
My fucking hand!
Lucky man.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
No!
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
What happened to you?
Back from where?
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
You're hurting.
Not know.
Tell me, damn you.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Hell...
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Which is where?
Where's Daddy?
Why not?
Are you O.K.?
Can I get you anything?
I'll be down in a minute
What are you talking about?
Oh?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
Wait a moment --
Where are you?
What did you say?
Me like.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Kitchen's through on your left.
Never better. You sleep well.
Really?
Of course.
Yes!
What's the problem?
It's late.
Not that late.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
I don't know.
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
Sonic Death Monkey.
No, you can't.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
On Clark Street!
Why?
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Uh.  That's me.
Is there a difference?
Fine.  That's great.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
-- FUCK OFF!
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Think about it, Rob.
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
-- Alright, alright but --
But don't you remember?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
It was kind of funny.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Uh... No.
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hi.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
I'm alright.
Where?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
Fair enough.
Enough of what?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
It's a great song.
I'm sure it isn't.
Whiskey.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
That way.  You?
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Yeah.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
You have an active imagination.
Why not?
You're a fool.
You are.  Now.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
It's beautiful.
At least.
I'm not even sure why.
Yes.
He is older than I.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
Come here, Brenna.
What is it you want?
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
The inheritance.
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
Stop.
Stop!
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
How can you know this?
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
I don't understand.
No!
You will live.  Survive.
Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Kiss me.
Not likely.
Your father must be smart.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Kahn?
What are you doing here?
He always did.
You're insane.
Are you here?
Your murder weapon?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
He's mistaken.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
The five hundred? Sure.
Then who are you?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
No -- she didn't.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
The insurance business?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Say, could I meet him?
No kidding?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Never mind that. What's the story?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
I get it!
Huh!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Sure.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
It'll be Heaven!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Who engineered this getaway?
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Not this gun!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Fred!
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
If there was any way out...
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I can't.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Editorials?
What did you do with her?
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Where's the money?
That man there!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
Very simple, Earl.
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Never mind! Just play dead.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
Pinkus.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Say, Hildy...
What's he want?
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Who told you that?
Who with?
It's not the same.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
Who pays for them?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
And the bride.
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Jam.
You taste it.
Fair enough.  The river.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
OK.
Is your brother ready to go?
Yeah, come on.
You're welcome.
That's not something to joke about.
I was just wondering.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Holy crap, thanks!
Hey, wait take this.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
No problem.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Oh.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
Not yet.
Keys.
Oh, right.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
I was just kidding.
Firefly.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
I ain't got a warrant.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Stop. Get away.
Please let me go with you.
But I like being human now.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Oh?
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Oh, Rosie.
With pleasure.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
I'm not sure.
I'm sorry?
I'll be out in a minute.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
That's a great idea.
I don't think so.  Why?
What?
He looks perfectly fine.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What?
Of course not.
I guess.
That was wonderful!
Oh boy!
Should I come with?
Ummm. It's good.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Ooka.
Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I don't have any interest in you anymore.  C'mon, monkey boy.
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
You know what's good for him?
To win.
Deal the cards.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
A thousand.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Thanks for the drink.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
I don't know when it was.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Sign up.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
How much?
'Bout even.
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
I'm a businessman, kid.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Is that what you think?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
Would you like to come out tonight?
Okay?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Heads.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Do you always ask so many questions?
So why go to college?
No. I'll take you home.
Give me a drag.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Why?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
Thanks.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Mm hmm.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Yeah. For a little while.
Give it back to me.
Is that what makes a winner?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Oh, grow up.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
I'm a little tired.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Where do you come from?
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
You watch me.
Let's go.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
Yes.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
You built things.
There's Cassius ...
Where's your car?
George, you're acting very strangely.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
I'd believe him.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
No.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
The back door was open.
You have to leave the White House.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
He's a good man.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Haven't you been watching?
What happened?
That signal. It's a countdown.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You still got the Olds?
Can't this thing go any faster?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
It's perfect the line is busy?
Oh shit, we're late.
Just getting a feel for her.
You as well.
I don't hear no fat lady.
We're being exterminated.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
It had been deemed classified.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
Sorry for what?
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
Jimmy, stay with me.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
We're leaving.
Above American soil?
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
And I am his.
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
We're through!
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
How do you know?
But what are you doing here?
I came to get you! What do you think?
Thank God!
Good point.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
She talks in her sleep.
Dad!
I'm out, Dad!
My Diary's in Berlin.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
It happens to me all the time.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
You think so?
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around.
Finally!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
No.
Why they glow like that?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Siam.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
What do you mean -- how?
Somehow I feel safer in here.
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Just try and control yourself.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Willie!
Not quite.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Figures...
Al ???!!!
What's going on?
Yes?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Who am I?
What are you doing in my head, Al?
I just went there for a job.
Then how'd I get here?
What for?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Of course you do!
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
With a man in my head...
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
What am I supposed to do?
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Try another language.
What?
Is something glinting?
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Not her. You!
It's not your time. I get time off.
It wasn't like that.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Drink lots of water.
Probably.
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
...Shit! It's just money.
About what?
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
I'll get us out of here.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Yes. Joe.
It's just money.
Here?
Oh.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
I don't know Who.
A little voice in my head.
The poet...something he said...
Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Me still. They left you alone?
That you're not crazy.
...Naw. Made that up.
What'd he steal?
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
Beats me.
Too late, they won't come back out till morning.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
You've  been there?
You coming along?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
I can't fly it.
For you.
If he was able, what would he say.
I told you, I work for him.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
I know a nice island.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
Yes.
Poor bastard.
Too much.
Whoever took it does.
Okay.
How long?
You got a deal. 
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Lunch?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
Then what are you going to do?
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
I'm afraid you are.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
How are you, Jim?
Why?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Why? Who said?
Use the bathroom.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Who's calling?
Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
Alright.
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
You eating with us?
No shit.
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
What?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
I just want to make sure that you both --
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Excuse me?
Who do you want me to kill?
Who's the pigeon?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
What is your husband's profession?
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Isn't everything?
No. I haven't. Have you?
So I hear. Is that all?
No. Don't stop.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Do you want to sleep on it?
I know.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
Oh Miles!
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Good.  Are those foods?
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
Those are gifts.
I fell in love Miles.
It's okay Joe.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
You have some?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
She did a Harriman.
Do you know him?
Well what does he want?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Oh brother. Here we go.
Rex, please.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
HA!
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Muriel Rumsey.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. 
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
What've you got against King Westley?
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
But the lady says
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
That's right. You didn't.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
What do you meanstarvation?
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he
was so scaredthat it scared
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Carrots.
What if nobody stops for us?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Oh, no!
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
Eat a carrot.
Come onget in.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
That's swell!
Congratulations.
Same to you.
The dame's too smart for him.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this officeunless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
Wait a minute, GordonI
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
You!
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is"  No, do you really?
Mush. Mush.
Mebbe.
Yes, Ma.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Got a couple of kids, huh?
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Yeah, I guess you do.
No, I'm not...
With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe? A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend. Shaw's got respect, the newspaper editors, the American Bar Association - they're not...
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
I did.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
What do you mean?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Why?  What's wrong?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
And Shaw?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
What?
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
No.  Never heard of him.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
No.
Allen Dulles?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
We need him back.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
No, it can't!
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
You have other information?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
You're so naive, mister.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
That's it.
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
And what would I have to do?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. Chief Justice, you have a lost cause. All I want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is. They will not give it to me, because I want to tell the truth... And then I want to leave this world.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What'd ya mean?
A bit.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Sure.
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
That's my diet shit.
Fine.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
Was she helpful?
Sure.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
Who is this?
It's nice.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Fifteen thousand.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
For now. These relationships never last too long.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
You know some interesting people.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
You do that?
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
He's liable to shoot you.
Why?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
What's he doing?
We're partners.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
I imagine shit needs to be done.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Uh-huh.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
What did you do after that?
I thought you were watching him.
Dreaming.
Thanks.
Got some o.j.?
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
I do okay.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I told them.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
I don't know. One of your friends.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
How do you know she did that?
I told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a scavenger hunt. She didn't know what that was neither.  No answer?
Designer clothes.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
So where did you go?
With Ordell?
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Uh-huh?
Are you sweating?
What's your cost?
Are you serious?
Which one is for the car?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
The moon -- I dunno
So we on the same page then?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
So you're sure she's dead.
You said five hundred and fifty!
Then what?
Where you shot her.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Watcha gonna see?
Cops can't locate him, huh?
He's a big one. You two tight?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Ten thousand sounds high.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
My office.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Uh-huh.
I know where to turn.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Where do you want to go?
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No, thanks.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Like Della.
Are you all right?
Oh God!
What do you want from me?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
I'm too messed up to teach.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
Why do you say that?
An explosion, just like Paul's.
What can I tell you?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I had this weird flash just then.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
What? By myself?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
Hell, you think I am?
New? He's been here for years.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I moved the couch. That's all.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
The best.
Why do you bring her up?
Oh, come on. It's early.
Where are we?
Show me Della!
Coming here?
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
What kind of man are you?
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Remember that.
What's he talking about?
I promise.
Please.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Sit down, Jake.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I no from around here.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Jacob Singer?
Speaking.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Why not?
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
I don't know. I don't know.
How did it happen?
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
Punk?
We're not leaving Crutch!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
No.
We made it?
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
Let's move out!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
And now we're all out of it.
Give me a break! What happened?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think so, why?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I'm on my way.
Well, do something!
Shut up, Thorgan!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Just get us to the ship!
So what else is new?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
You need to get laid!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
We're missing two of the kids!
Thirty seconds.
I gotta go back.
I didn't say he was alive.
Old Earth?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
I know who he is...
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
No!
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
No. Home here.
Do I need any more authority?
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
Chum?
Why don't we just tow it in?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
I wish it would rain...
It's a whale out there.
Just keep kicking.
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
You picked her up on the ferry.
What's the matter with my printing?
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
Twenty years.
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Let me see your hands...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
You know how I feel about her.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I'm pregnant.
Whose idea was it?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
You know it's okay.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
Can we make out now?
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
What is your job title, exactly?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
Cool it.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Blood and guts.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
Junk?
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Keith's hot.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Looks like it, yeah.
Is it hard to learn?
Took 'em all.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
...I don't know.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Dahlia, no.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
If you say so.
Damn right I do.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Thank god!
Carrie.
Look again!
I'm finished.
Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up!
Not yet.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
She wasn't feeling so good.
...Brian hurt his foot.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
...Janitor's job.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
How?
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
You think?
Darcy?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Casper, where's Telly.
I had a female vagina last night.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
You were?
I just know. I know you'll love it.
No...
Here. Swallow.
Come dance.
What?
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
No.
Thanks.
You are being ripped open.
Passion...
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Yeah?
You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Yep.
He still does.
No.
But then I won't need your money.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
All right.
Hello?
Yep.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
I wouldn't know.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
I was at the beach.
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Who is this?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Then call them!
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
The pipes.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
Fuck off!
Why did he what?
Come here.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
But you promised.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
Anything else?
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
Then I'll transpose.
I suppose you have something in mind?
Is it serious?
Who says something's on my mind.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
It seems like such a complicated game.
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
She could be dead after the game.
That's not fair!
No -- I'm not involved.  And I plan on keeping it that way.
No.  You were talking about chess.
What do you want on it?
Where's the note?
You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
That's worse.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
All the passages are guarded.
Of course it was.
Does the Queen live?
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You won't have to.
You have not slept in two days.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
He has come for Lyssa.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
I'm all right.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Yes.
I knew.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
It is the time.
Ynyr!
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You lie!
No.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Well, I don't need them...
OK.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
Why?
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...17.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Then...
It's impossible.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
How long does this... Mania last?
Can it kill me?
It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
Yes -- you are.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
I've changed my mind.
Where?
Pacifica, California.
I told you.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
So I've been informed.
It's mine to risk.
In a hospital.
It's yours.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
This isn't right.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
Orange soda?
No.
Sparkling apple cider?
Water?
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
I sometimes fade out.
To death?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
No, I can't have dinner with you.
You OK out there?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Don't be silly?
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
When?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Yes... I'll give you that.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Let's stay for a while.
OK.
What did they look like?
How much, do you think?
Where are you staying?
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
With an old friend.
No.
I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
I loved him!
I'll take that as a no.
Are we done for today?
I believe we are.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Where you got in the shower.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
-- uh --
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Aristotle.
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
Spill.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
Uh -- family.
I'm her sister.
I'm still can't believe you didn't tell Donovan the alibi.
You think?
Your scrunchie?
Power yoga?
Why?
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
What?!
Are you asking me on a date?
Why not?
I don't know --
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
And I fully support that.
That's why I think it's time for us to --
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Harvard. Law school.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I gave her my word, Warner.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Where's the Rock?
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Your love.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
To be my bride, of course.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
I see...
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
It looks... er, delicious...  Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Don't you know?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
What do I do?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
No false modesty, lad.  You're a proper champion.  Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Beware.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We're not in a tournament, Gump.  Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
There's the way, mates.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Will you chance a miss?
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Sunlight, you say?
What weapon?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Go on... go on...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
I'll go search for it.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
My lady mocks me.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
And I love you, my husband.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Not very precise directions.
She's dead!
Dead, dead, dead.
You'll visit again?
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
Heading north still?
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
A castle's but stone and mortar --
In a dream.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Who are you?
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Hi.
I don't know.
He jumped into the ocean.
No thanks.
I can use your mom's.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
It could have been a squirt gun.
We've known each other since grade school.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Months.
What are you on?
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
Maybe that's too long.
That's too long.
Forty.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Good.  I was hoping for that.
I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
You're here early today.
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Goodnight.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
Hey...hey!
I don't know.
I'm not even listening.
I like how it feels not to feel.
How do you become something you're not?
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I would have killed him.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
You lied to me!
I can die trying.
I need you to do me a favor.
I don't even care if he ever comes back.
What did you do with your dog?
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
I love those doors.
I want him with me.
Which?
Sam's favorite.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
This was my very first slow dance.
You've never said that before.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
Despite you.
That's the problem.
I don't know what I'm doing.
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Dad's home, already?
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
He's a big one.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Take care of me?
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Start your job? What kind of job?
No, tell me what's so funny.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
I'm sure it don't.
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
You drew this?!
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
Say what?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
Let me see that.
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
I'm all right.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Made just for you, Cookie.
Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Just like Elvis.
Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Anybody else need anything read?
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Please, get out of my mind!
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Absolutely not.
And he's dead serious.
What do you think about... Earth?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Don't do it!
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
My mom wasn't a goat?
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Oh. Sorry.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Well, let's rock and roll.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Release the evil?
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
It's Stanley, sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
You keep a bat under your seat?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
If you want to.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Good. I was concerned.
What?
No.
Off limits.
I don't know.
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
All right -- what are you?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
You're a beautiful pair.
I am.
And I did it myself right on there.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
Six. I go red next year.
All right.
I wish I could help you.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
I have.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Is it inside the city?
Yes...
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
I don't know... but it does.
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
Hello.
Gracious... no.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
And all alive you say?
Oh, yes... I think...
This is our bedroom.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Can I call you?
Are you positive he knows?
We should stop seeing each other.
Pornos.
Andy?
Yeah. Call him.
We killed him.
Alice?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
What night is that?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Pete, what happened to you?
Nothin'.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
That's why I married you.
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
I wish I knew.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Who is this?
What?
No... I told you.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Oh, I see.
Why, of course. Yes.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Will you stop squawking!
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Think of it! In times like these.
Gold. You were going to
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Nothing. Why?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
That's intelligent.
Oh, good heavens, no!
Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
buy and sell?
Well, is it?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Shall we have another?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Suppose she should leave it?
Please let me help you.
Yes.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Now, what would you like to do?
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
Yes.
You?
Yes, Bob.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Porters?
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
She's going with me.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
Yes.
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Why aren't you registered through our office?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
What do you suggest?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
Yes.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
You see, it's not a dream.
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
I was just going to.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
It's not even a fucking door.
Then where did it-- ? Sir.  Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
You do?
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
Sir, you can't just--
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
Right.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I taught kindergarten.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
You don't know me at all.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
And what's this ... ?
Where to?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
The radio show?
The Pentagon.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
I'd double it and add 20.
Do his job.
in case I need it?
Actually, you may have.
They respond to fear, right?
Yeah ... ?
Give or take.  It was right around your civil war, I think, when I was here last.  We were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
I dunno. One?
What are you talking about, it's coming?  What's coming?
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
Dee?  What are you doing here?
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
Oh shit!
Don't tell me.  Insects.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Is it now?
What?
Why?
She grew up.
RUN!
Somewhere.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
... Graveyard shift.
Don't apologize, John.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
In the middle of the night?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You can't run --
Uh, sir...
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
The mall?
Go back to work.  All of you.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
I need help with her.
They don't belong to anybody.
What the hell.
Oh, Sean --
I'm your son.  I'm you.
He's alive?
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
You don't seem all that proud.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Hold that thought.
He's dead, Lara.
Oh, God, what did you do?
I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
We know why John was tagged.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
Not quite.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
How many?
None.  This was arranged.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
Have you been there recently?
What does he want with a precog?
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Yeah.
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
We're in Fashion.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
He's okay.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
It's daytime.
He's not doing it.
I don't know.
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Oh, please.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah. Where is he?
So, when's the drop.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Quick drop. In and out.
Ricky's taken care of.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
I'll work it off.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
No. Okay. I'll think about it.
Yeah.
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Well, this is the corner.
No. That's cool, man.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
He's not here.
So, it's not a winning record.
Don't be shitty.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
He implied it.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
I'll beat your ass --
What are we delivering?
It's not even yours.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Forty-six.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Well, I don't want to walk.
Fuck...
Don't even start.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
What the fuck is that supposed --
I don't know.
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Fine.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
She was jonesing for me.
What's up?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
No.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
You did?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
You really in trouble?
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
No, really, mate?
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Thanks.
What?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Don't con me. Don't try...
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
Who are you?
Then the devil is white.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Come, sit with us.
She ate.
If you want to tell me.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Dear heart, where are you?
I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Then we don't know that God was white.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
And like a fool I believe it.
With him?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You're my father.
And don't come back.
You hear me, girl?
What's your story, baby?
Fine as May wine.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Eat lead, coppers.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
Tell him about Baldy.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
So you are going to talk me to death.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
I have connections.
Give me the address.
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[Daniel what?]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[Her life for your life.]
[Lucky how?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
No.
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Time will tell.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
You don't drink like you used to.
Never.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
[Yes.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
This is Mr. Creasy.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Hmm?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
It's not.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[A beautiful circle.]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Two tourists who never went home.
That's what friends do.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
What was she to Creasy then?
What makes you say that?
I'll call her up.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
She wasn't so bad.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
It's her baby too, you know.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I'm thirty-four.
I don't.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Marty...
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Sure.
Goodnight.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Marty...
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
What, Ma?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Hello, Thomas.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
I don't wanna talk about it!
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
Wisconsin.
You make a mean martini, kid.
I got some.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
Be right with you.
Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
I have a tent to myself.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I think we could still have a chance.
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
But I'm married.
Ayuh.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
I didn't mean with me.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
The one and only.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
Homosexuality.
No, never in the slightest.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
I wonder, if Red's fix swings it for me, what's heaven really like?
You can cut the bow.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
What's that, Henry?
Yeah?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
Nice.
Are you all right?
Uh-huh.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
You didn't?
How do you do.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
All set, Ann?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
The Websters.
The Websters!
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
There is no letter. I made it up.
So?
Well, you're catching on.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
I wish he had a family, though.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Take it easy, John Doe.
That's
Oh, let me go, will you!
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Beany!
Look!
The heelots!
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
Sure, you are.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Flowers.
She isn't?
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
Clarence Teal.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
I won't get away with it.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
How can I help you with the particles?
Huh?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Am I gettin' the car?
You got it.
Earl.
Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
Is that all?
Spread it out.
Sorry... Habit.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Why? You like my ass?
It's against my nature.
I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
About six years. My partner took me.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
I worship you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
What do you want from me?
If you did, you never showed it.
Ronnie...
As a matter of fact, I do.
...Let me just show you.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
Scottie...
Do it!
Hmm?
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Scott...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I'll provide you with transportation.
They have nothing to do with this --
Yes, I believe he has --
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
No...
Nothing, go back to sleep.
True.  But why?
New York.
Go!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
-- Come on, you know F.C.O. regs. Anyone caught with their R and D hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  It's not worth it.
To hide the evidence.
Then where is she?
Way you kiss me.
Sorry?!
Because you'll never believe me.
Activated.
-- Standard.
Resurrection.
Ah... sure.
Now tell me... what do you see?
What's a Triac?
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
A real shame.
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
... A falcon?
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
How'd you know?
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Tell me about it.
But not you.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Who hired the bastard?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
For what?
I needed to see you again.
You got something to hide?
It always is.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
How soon can we pull this off?
Who?
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
He's trying to make it.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
The kid just called me stupid.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
You get fifteen percent.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
Okay. I'm listening.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Shuddup.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Back? You're sending me back?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Uh huh. And?
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
Give me a date, Doctor.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
What pictures?
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Oh, I hope so, dear.
I can make my own decisions.
What happened?
What does he do?
Forty-five all total.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
I did not--
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
You got worms.
Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer down--
That's taking place outside now.
Drunks are funny--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
I apologize.
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
What?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
No--not offhand--
Susan? Nah!
You know, we're getting married.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
We're waiting, Hubert.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Oh! Go away.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Henry Hill.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
It does!
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I have no defense against forged papers and--
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
The man downstairs said number--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Right.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
How?
Thanks very much.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
No.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Letitia.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
In Terry Canyon?
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Must have been tickled pink.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Thanks a lot.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Where do we go from here?
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Oh--you are!
Then you *did* say it.
Swell!
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
That's right.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you mean?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Joe--what's the matter with you-- where you're concerned, I wouldn't take the slightest risk--'specially now after the great reputation you've made in the Senate. Why, look at this campaign I've started for you in all my papers. You're the logical man from the West on the National ticket--at the convention, anything can happen--
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Do I actually *see* this--?
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Uh-huh.
Always.
Next, please.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Oh - uh - nothing.
Oh, I don't mind.
I enjoy it.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Nothing
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Is he really that big a sap?
Had the boys follow us.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Yes.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Yes, but you said
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
We'll send for the police!
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Hang up.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
All right.
Huh?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Huh?
That's funny. Why is that?
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Arthur wants to quit!
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Ja.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh. That.
Now wait a minute, buddy
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Proceed.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Now you keep out of this!
Yes, ma'am.
Is she home?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Yeah.
Doubtful. What did he say?
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Good, then go.
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
No?
I didn't hear you.
What?!
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
What do you think's wrong with her?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
Sure.
Don't need it.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Mother... go away!
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Something's bothering her.
Sorry... I'm done.
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Either one.
Yeah?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Of course.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Okay...
Hello.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
What'd he say?
How are you?
Nah... scotch.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs?
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Holy shit!
Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
See you Thursday... regular time.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Really?
What'd I do?
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
You're not going to kill us?
In the desert? What for?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Intestines.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
Water turning to blood.
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I would never!
Forty.
No.
No, I mean --
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
If you call that a kiss.
We're about to be shown the way.
Why would I do that?
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
That bad huh?
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
FINE.
Got what?
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Yes,... I see.
Um, well, you see...
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
Um-hmm.
Do I?
Really?
When was that?
Atta, boy!
He was cute though.
Me, too.
They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
Get on to yourself!
Why not?
Why?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
Monica, where are you?
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
It is not dead. It is hiding.
We had an off night, that's all.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
So why don't you just tell her!
Or flowers.
Yes.
Anybody got any?
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
Not yet.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
I use it... to fight evil.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Or Batman --
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Proceed.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
What forces do you have at your disposal?
Where are they?
And who is defending Paris?
And where is Joseph?
It is a terrible shock.
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I am.
Thank you, sir.
You may go, Captain Charles.
Ajaccio.
I see...
It is the work of incendiaries.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Lisette.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
No...
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
No.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
You couldn't face telling me what?
About Hippolyte Charles.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Yes, he has.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
Well, let me in.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Can I look for myself?
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
I know, be still.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Why?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
What about me?
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I don't know.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I'll remember.
Excuse me?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Call me.
What?!
I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
That ain't gonna work.
What?
I can't feel my legs no more.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
Business or pleasure?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
That's right.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
For what?
For not believing you.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
Good.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
No way.
All right.
Keep it.
Please...
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Who?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Don't think I won't.
I don't know.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I see. Where is this gun?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
It doesn't look like it.
Help me get her off the rug.
Shut up.
It's time. It's time now.
Come with me, honey.
Do it!
What do you figure he done with it?
No, Ben.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
I'll bet.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
Fiddlesticks!
John don't like him much.
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Satan.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
You what?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Ahh!
A strange woman is a narrow pit!
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
I was praying.
Answer me!
The Drugstore?
I been out with men.
Now who was this?
Get the kit!
Because he was scary, that's why.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
The killer.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
What!?
Meanwhile...?
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
'Anything funny' like what?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Like Rod Lane?
Yes, Mother. G'night.
We should get her out of here...
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Aren't you late?
What are you serving?
And you too, Ninotchka.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
With two f's, if you please.
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Thank you, Louis.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I'll send you a muff.
A day.
Monsieur.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
You want me to go in there?
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
But you had!
I think so too.
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Me?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Thank you.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
So that is your house?
And what is your profession?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
That is correct.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
As a representative of Moscow...
Then how did you get here?
What are you after?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Then you should go back to your table.
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
Did you make any change in this room?
What, darling?
No speech?
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
...and we won't clench our fist...
All right.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Huh?
You can't imagine.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
Go on.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Yes.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask why?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Where is it?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
So ... let's go ...
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
This is not a joke, John!
No, sir.
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
I don't have a pistol.
That's what they're doing.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
He's completely lost touch with reality.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Silence!
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
... an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to become involved in Latin America.  We would lose all our friends in Latin America.
Jesus!
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
Money.  Follow the money.
Sir?
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Sir?
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
How?
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Kissinger?
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
Yes.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
That was a long time ago.
I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Ernie Davis.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Elvis I like, too.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
So I'm supposed to be ...
Fire him.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Yeah ... I'm out.
Is that the truth?
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Who else'd be in your truck.
I am older.
How come're you doin that?
Nineteen zero and nine.
I'm... discouraged.
Try "old" on for size.
He's real all right.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Some pretty bad people.
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Uh-huh.
That from the lock?
Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Yessir.
I always am.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
That'll be the day.
No. I found it.
What're you doin', baby?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Hey.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I mean the nature of you.
Screwgie.
Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well...
You know she won't be there.
So what're you goin' up there for.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Sir?
I said you don't know what you're talking about.
You've lived here all your life?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
I didn't put nothin' up.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Everything.
Somethin' like that.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
It's all right.
Okay. We can stop that.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
Another additional.
I got beers in my room.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I know how he found me.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm retired.
I don't mean braze.
I don't know. American citizens.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
You should get the order you want.
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
...plenty
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
Yeah?
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Anyway, so what?
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
"Banners?"
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
You knew Del?!
You're late, Eric.
Yes, she is.
What happened when you were twelve?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
Thanks...
I don't know.
It was Chloe...
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
How did you know?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
...did I win some contest?
The Five?
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
What? Where was he?!
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
You told me how to do it!
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Should I kill him now?
What the hell's the matter with you?
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I'm not telling.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
It is, if you like idiots...
You better believe it.
He's waiting...
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
What the hell's going on?
I SAID FORGET IT!
Better.
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
I swear to God!
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Fire! I hate fire!
Gopher, Everett?
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Izzat right?
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Oh, okay.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You -
You didn't know that at the time!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip.  I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers!
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Blooey!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Okay, okay. You win.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Aw screw it...
How're you doing, Sarge?
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Yes I do!
Then, I'll see you around.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
But in what ways?
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
Not me.
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
He didn't give you much choice.
I know who you are and what you want.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
That's it?
I don't want you to move.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
Because he's my friend, too.
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
But she expects you to marry her?
Do you know that for sure?
Yes.
You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
She better.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
NOT THAT ONE?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Keep your voice down.
They're not supposed to be here!
So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
They're coughing.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Adios.
Huh?
Can we come in?
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
I said open the door.
Got us in here, didn't I?
PANIC ROOM!
I heard you.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Don't though. 
Blue is phones?
Stop it.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Okay.
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Get out of the fucking car.
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
No man. PE -- "political education."
I see. What about the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
We need money first...
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
They were empty...
Just a kid.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Just the legit shit.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
Mom! It wasn't like that. It was bullsh... They were just harassing us. No charges were filed. It's alright.
I expect to try.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
He's my father.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
My pleasure, sir.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
What officers?
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
Not yet.  What happened?
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Oh?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Is that so?
Yes...  ... father.
I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
You know what happened.
It's Mister Marion.
Balderdash!
And your principles?
Thank you.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
Long time.
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
How many men have we seen die?
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
But what about Thomas?
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
That bad?
And what is the second thing?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Yayyy!
To remember.
Huh?
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
This time I mean it.
Whose burying ground?
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Good d--
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
I'll torture it out of you.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
What're you suggesting?
Now.  No, don't kill him.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Would that I could.
Very good.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Not as a condition -- a request.
That would hardly be proper.
Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
The trees are taller.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
More to drink!
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
Exactly.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Aye, that'll about do it.
What?  He never told me that.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Sorry, I didn't know.
I said, no lies.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Only a little.
Move!
Somewhat.
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Barbossa.
It's the right way.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
... No.
No.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
The nanobot is gone.
That might work.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
Daniel!
The waste.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
It's still inside me?
No cheese.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
That's going to fit me?
Where is it?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Dexter.
No? Why not?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
I know that.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Oh yes you will wear garters
Are you crazy?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Thanks, I will.
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Yeah, little Gloria.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Why not?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
No?
Outside!
I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Yes.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
I bet.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Hello, Stew.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Right.
Here you are.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
I suppose you know why I came?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Are the cars ready?
Get out of here.
Yes - the worm!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Me, sir?
It's haunted just the same.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yes.
Very good, sir.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
What do you mean?
Yes.
No, no ... Come on in.
I think it looks nice.
She's crying.
Yes she is.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
Where are you gonna go?
But where would we go?
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
We were gonna ... You know ...
With what?
No. Of course not.
Well, I never had to do it before.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
What's that like?
We'll just put up the top.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
Right. And how did she dress him?
What department store did they go to?
Ooomph?
Excuse me?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
Yeah ...
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
I brought you something ... From the library.
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
What's the listing?
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I have work, I can't leave.
I'm sorry.
What?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Yes.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Sure.
No.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
It doesn't matter.
...yeah.....
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Yeah.
No. I'm sorry.
I know I did. But I don't.
I don't know.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
I think that'll be fine.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
Yeah.
You like her?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What happened?
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
...I don't know what you mean....
I don't freak out.
Ok.
Thank you.
I just wanted to make sure.
...what...?
This is nice.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Did you have my home phone number?
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Just have you for one second, please.
No.
Well who did?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Yes I did.
I think you have a call?
I didn't know you had a sister?
Yeah.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
That's funny.
Hi.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
I'm sorry.
Yes. Sorry.
What time are you gonna be there?
Seriously.
Yeah but I'm serious.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Now give the signal.
Yes, Abbe?
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
What? What've I done?
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
AND DID YOU?
Was it impotence?
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
You'd suffer in her stead?
HER NAME, ABBE.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Come now, darling, give it a read.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
Forgive me, I beg you --
You've come to lecture me?
Last week would this be?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Houdini mice.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Randolph!
Over at RKO?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
I will not defend my life to you--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
I just want to understand--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Yes?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Telling stories.
Showing life
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Orson, please ... it's too bright
I expected more from you.
Don't do this
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
Why her?
She was . . . innocent
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
I just can't . . see it anymore
So they're Jews. . .
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
What does this have to do with--?
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
To do what?
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I don't want to sit
Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
How can he embarrass you?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
It's not done.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Yeah --
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Huh?
With her? How?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
You want the title shot?
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
You sound bitter.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
No, I'm not.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
C'mon, Tommy --
Excuse me for living.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
It don't look right.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
His wife took a trip.
-- until yesterday morning.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Ever get an answer?
Mrs. Thorwald.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
I don't want to.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Anything else bothering you?
Make the one you want.
Yes.
For what?
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
Homework. It's more interesting.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
125 West Ninth Street.
To get on home.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Inside stuff?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I do?
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
I'm cute, too.
Somebody find him a knife.
Okay.
You see any cops?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
You make any sandwiches?
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
I don't want to learn that!
No thanks, I don't smoke.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Well maybe she better start.
Come back tomorrow.
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
Who's that!
We'll take it!
I'm what?  What?
I'm fine.
Why?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
No.
I don't know why--!
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
So then you moved?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
You serious?
Yes, ma'am.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Dig the square wardrobe!
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
I don't know.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Are you?
You don't need to do that.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
So do you.
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
What?
My mother?
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Searching for a money man...
He'll be dead when he does.
You are to me.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
Nick...
What the fuck is going on.
You sold him out.
Nick, I love you --
JESUS CHRIST!
Get your own room.
Don't say my name...
Part of... with them?
What are you talking about?
Put him in the truck.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
What's her greatest fear?
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
I said, who the hell made the map?
I did.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know.  If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out.
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
Take 'em.
Mr. Bangs.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
Five years. Since it opened.
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
Hi, Nick.
How do we take them out?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
How do we do that?
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Yeah.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
No, man! No, no, no!
Do what?
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
But... I had a five...
First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that?
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
You're coming back to work for us, right?
Was he all pissed off?
How do you know all this?
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
Dead as Dillinger.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
You gonna put it away?
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
He don't tip.
You do?
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Correct.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
You don't believe in tipping?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
So you wanna git bit, huh?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
You don't mean that Clay.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Like what?
In a fight?
This is an awful nice gun.  Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
I don't care.
Don't act so -- crazy.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Now where's she goin'? --
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
That's the end of the line.
I feel good anyways.
And you've got me all figured out?
Steve --
Ha! Right bitch!
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Never happened!
Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Let's get a hot dog.
It's okay.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
Alright, let's take a vote...
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Uh, uh.
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Saw who?!
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
What is it, Dwight?
What?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Okay, give me my belt.
My holy water.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Dog, you look hot.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
She wouldn't...
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
She sure can pick 'em!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
I certainly did.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
I didn't do it!
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
Yes... but... I didn't...
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
What's he know?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
She could use a hundred dollars.
She can only use cash.
Hello, Frances.
I guess most people are.
A job?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Who the devil is he?
But I'm not joking.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
They may have been friends of hers.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I'd like that.
But you would like to know where she is?
Unless what?
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
What?
It won't hurt.
Younger.
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Impotent.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Of course not.
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
I'm sorry this came up.
Yes, I do.
Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
Why?
That's correct.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
No, you're not.
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Why not?
But I don't understand --
But you're planning to be?
Not entirely.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Why not?
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Why don't I believe you?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
What do you mean?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Well, I wonder why.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No, it's nothing like that.
I don't know.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
You don't know that for sure.
You couldn't do it, period.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
You want me to leave?
Nope.
Nope.
About what?
I just want to ask you questions.
And you ask questions, right?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
No.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
What did he say?
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
You're intrigued?
Cynthia. John.
I want to see you.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Why not?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Who?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Will you lease month-to-month?
What do you mean?
No.
Brian Kirkland, please.
One moment.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Down to the incinerator.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
A wreck.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
Why Janet?
Who trusts experts?
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
I don't want to get up there.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
Could you tell us a little about it?
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
I NEED SOME
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
Farley!
Flavors!
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
SIN-I-FUL
Surely.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
I love you.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
And?
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
That's what people say.
Stephanie.
Maybe. Recognize this?
You said you had it all lined up.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
Just tell me.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I'd rather have a knife.
And Lexapro, yes.
And get your bone smooched.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Huh.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
You're blind, dude. Blind.
Beautiful.
You have the keys.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Oh Jesus, Miles.
What? Of course I like Christine.
That was three years ago after that first party!
You're an asshole.
Shut up.
I don't want to talk about it.
What exactly are we going to do?
No.
Let's leave it alone.
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Keep it elevated.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Quite a week.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
The Windmill.
What was the bottle that did it?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah, same here.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Oh. You mean... today?
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Yeah? Like what?
Got it.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
But you wanted to fuck me first.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Ken.
French or American?
Both.
I told you I need a drink.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Does she ever answer back?
A hair.
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
I got him.
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
What are you doing?
It's getting stronger.
It's old Morgan.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Oh.
Dad.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
The family room.
Sorry.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
What do you mean, the horses?
Honest to God, Emmett, he would've killed me.
McKendrick.
Sounds good.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
Ten A.M.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Not for five years.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
South of here, past Chimayo.
Which way do you mean?
It never is. But he's my brother.  We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Never will again.
Because they don't like what I want.
We wait.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Where's Emmett now?
What about his brother?
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
And I know what I'm talking about.
Here he comes right now.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I thought you two would get along.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Please.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
Why isn't she with you?
I can't wait to meet her.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
"Forever".
She'll drive herself.
Well, shoot it on the last day.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Everyone you know is lying.
She doesn't want pity.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Excuse me?  Start?
I just read somewhere --
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Hello, Hal.
Absolutely not!
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
This week anyhow.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
This is the story.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
I will when you're finished writing it.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Good.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
That's good.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
Lots of things.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
They used to hang people here.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
S-ssssstop it!
Which street corner?
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
He's right. Nice guitar break.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You know who I am. You invited me.
"Blood?"
What's wrong?
You got something against farm people, Keith?
He started it.
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
Don't look.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
Yeah, I'll teach you a lesson --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
You took Bill.
It's my nature.
We're coming your way, man!
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
It's just a work thing.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
Grant, no!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
Who'd want to?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Shoot.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
No.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Let's keep it that way.
Can a pig whistle?
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
Then don't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
You okay?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Where the hell are you?
Oh.
Chickenshit money.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Yeah.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Yeah, why.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
You're finished.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
I wouldn't go that far.
-- he's doing it then, huh --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Wow.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
That's fantastic.
Not her.  It.
You fucking bastard...
How?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
And professionally?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
I don't know.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
And tonight?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Then it's God, right?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
I think so.
Yes.  Yes.
No.  I love you.
Those are dreams.
It's all right.
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Don't call me that.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Yes, you are --
You must have been dreaming.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Hard to find doors in this place.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
Let's get a drink.
He said he'd kill me.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Urdu and Hindi.
Yeah, what a woman.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
So it was "love".
And "is"...?
Very nice.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
Stop being nuts!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
What do you want to do?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
"For"...?
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
What?
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I think -- she's crazy.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
Even Joey Venza?!
Is she injured?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Be nice.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I'm parked illegally!
Harry
I got you a present.
Lemme down, bugface!
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Fine.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
But you like that in a man?
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
I'm here...
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
Precise equipment such as waldos
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Anyway, I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
I don't care.  Cretin.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I'll try. Thanks.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
In this barracks?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
How much more do we have to take from him?
105-353.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
Isn't it?
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Where'd that come from?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
He's the grrrrreatest!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Let me alone.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Are we boring you?
Says me.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
You can tell Father Murray to --
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
What guy?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Not particularly.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Thanks for pointing that out.
When is it expected back?
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Can you project its course?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
You get what?
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
It's our pleasure.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
I hadn't planned on it.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
I thought you might.
Aye.
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
Make it so.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
Trilithium?
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
... Fascinating.
A photon tube...!
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Do you have an explanation?
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
What's wrong?
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Goodbye, David.
What? What are you saying?
. He will remain always as he is.
Why would you do this...?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
... A cloaking device?
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Yours...?!
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
You should take the Vulcan, too.
No.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
Yes...
You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you <U>must</U>.
Understood, my lord.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
All true.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Say thank you.
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Our first order of business is survival.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
I have my orders.
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
What do you want with us? I demand --
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
He's on a build up to detonation!
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
I'm trying, David.
I am truly sorry.
Let them eat static.
Raise the shields...
Aye, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Scotty, let's have it.
Give the word, Admiral.
Aye, sir.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Or the one.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
A distinct possibility.
Best we could do in two hours.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
I did not think so.
Take the test again.
Understood, sir.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Scotty!
Ready, sir.
I would accept that as an axiom.
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
What do you think, Spock?
... My shoes...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
My name?
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
I'm wery sorry, but --
"Neutralized?" How?
Can you protect us?
We are launching everything we have.
I suppose they told you that...?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
We don't want to be any trouble.
You've already been that. C'mon.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Noon tomorrow...?!
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
A spaceship with a missing man.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
I see.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
... I see.
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Everyone remember where we parked.
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Mr. Sulu?
The explosive override -- ?
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
But not you.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
For someone so young.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
From the mission...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Thank-you for reminding me.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
Why not?
It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
What are they interested in...?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
I look forward to reading your report.
Yes...
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
At least four hours.
More lies.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
<U>Engage.</U>
One minute to warp threshold...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
We're crossing the threshold!
Main bus...
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm very sorry.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Steady as she goes.
Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
Life signs?
Yes, sir.
What?
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Emergency override!
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves?
You may need assistance, doctor...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
That cunning little Vulcan...
Spock's looking for us...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
You feign ignorance?
He just tried to save him!
There... were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?
That isn't true...!
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Anything else you want to tell me?
It IS possible.
WHO ELSE...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Sir?
Uhura, signal our surrender.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
They're dying.
What peace conference?
Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
I think  not.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
This one can.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I do not understand.
No. I must deactivate you.
For how long?
Is he very much like you were?
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
I can see that.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
How can you be sure?
You do not look like me.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Do you have a moment, sir?
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
You sick bastard!
Ready, sir!
Number One.  You have the bridge.

Just lucky, Admiral.
Aye, sir.
Your new chair, sir.
And the Romulans invade.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
With a full head of hair.
Why am I here?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
We are.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Long ago.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
Runs in the family.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
Let's go.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
No -- this is wasting time.
Seven minutes.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
I have a purpose.
I'll take that.
He's got a gun!!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Where did you stop last?
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
What's all this for?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
What.
Eh... police.
Flashlight.
X...
What are you doing?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
You better.
No.
Do you have a baby?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Goodbye.
What?
Yes.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
On the radio they say it's good.
Hurry up.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
I understand.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
I know how to gamble now.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Slow down, slow down.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
You have no conception of this, do you?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
The police think he was high on drugs...
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Maybe later.
What're you going to do?
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Tonight.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Step into my office.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
I'm on her.
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
Is he dead?
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
What clip?  What was it?
Your existence.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Rams... that's football, right?
It gives me... I don't know... maybe two hundred people who I know wear.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
Something in your car...
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
There's a plus side?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
This isn't in our database?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
What's the bad news?
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
You must travel a lot, huh?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
What are you doing?
He got away. I had him. He got away.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
The man knew how to dress.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
And one other thing.
Sex.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
Just routine stuff.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
What's going on?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
You knew it was me all along?
If I owe, I will go.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
350 miles.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
You've been through worse.
Are you calling Her?
Hi.
I like quiche.
Anything.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
...And she's with someone else.
Oh... right.
It's a rebound.
I would love to see you again sometime.
I'll be around.
Let me get a pen out of my car.  Do you have something to write on?
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
...Which one...?
Yeah, hold on.
...Six months.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Goodbye. I lov... 
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
Right.
Well that sucks.
What do you want? You're tall.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I didn't mention her once today.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I do. Good for you, man.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
An eight.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
Well, let's hit that party.
Oh, like that song...
I'll be your winger.
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
That's your problem, man. You can't see what you've got, only what you've lost. Those guys are right. You are "money".
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
What are they doing here?
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
I know, but...
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
She smiled, baby.
I don't think so.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I don't know...
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
No! Not the camera guy!
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
How?
I just need some time...
I hear she's getting real fat.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
She didn't see.
...How novel.
You think?
True.
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...you're money...
...it is so on.
Six.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
An eye for an eye!
Good, good.  Leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport.
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Understood.
OK, but be careful.
Maybe less...
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Barzini.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about Rocco Lampone building a secret regime.  Why does Neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?
Did he give you his politicians?
I told you you wouldn't like him.
Oh Michael.
Don't you want dinner first?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
I'm busy.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
I do renounce them.
The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
We?
Shut up!
Okay.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
It's just an undercoat. 
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
I didn't mean with you in it.
Relax.
Is Freddie here?
What are you talking about?
She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
That's good.
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
Oh God, I don't think so.
I love Marge.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
No, he should talk to you alone.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Bird. That's jazz.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Marge, when did you get here?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Hello Marge!
Tom.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I think we sort of found each other.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
As in the...?
I'll take them both.
What?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know what -- I am.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
Ten thirty?
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
You try. You try talking to her.
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
Or Tom and Peter even.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
...Tom is a mystery...
November, I thought.
I don't remember the exact date.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
It is a little coarse, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I got money.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
That's really something.
You must be rich.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
But this is a porno movie.
I mean porno movies.
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
And what happened?
A real skunk.
We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
Iris.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
But that one night?
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What's so important?
Cops don't do nothin.
There's porno theatres for that.
No, I want long shifts.
So I hear.
Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Why?
Oh?
What's going on?
Thanks.
Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
Well yes I suppose ...
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
I am, too.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
Yes.  Hic!
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Oh...
Oh.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
What's that?
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
A super market.  Huh.
And... what's my name again?
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Vultures...
Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
I know.  A Purple Heart.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
It's about me.
My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Cathy?
It's a lovely garden.
No. Just a few hours.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
I think so.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Look.
They're birds!
Well, I suppose...
Are you coming to my party?
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Try my best.
Yes?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
The little girl's name.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
When?
We won't be here.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Oh, thank you.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
We know what it is, Al.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Goodnight, Lydia.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
He's not home.
Monday?
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
I understand completely, sir.
No, of course not.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
How do you know Annie?
Yes.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Maybe.
What?
Without any clothes on?
And you didn't come up here to see her.
No.
What did it say?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
I'm glad you do.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Yes.
I think I should, don't you?
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
How long have they been gathering there?
Have we still got power?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Help how? What do you want to do?
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come in, boy -- come in.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray killed her.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
What do you mean, Fettes?
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
They'll be thinking of that, too.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
I want it --
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
You will not have it?
I am the best man for the job.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
But what makes a thought start?
I would make you rich.
Burke them?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
How long ago?
Perhaps -- a delicate operation -- an operation which has never been performed -- but it could be performed.  I'm sure it could be -- I could incise the columna dorsi --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
Not tonight. Honest.
Just hold on to me.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
About you.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
No -- not at all.
Yes -- of course.
Maybe a little demonstration.
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Where is that?
Yes -- I think so.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Come on in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Naturally I think so.
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
What time is it?
I'm sorry.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
Wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>.
That's just the way we like it.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
I will, David!
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
There's a cop behind us.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Sam, don't --
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
It was a dream, Star.
He's not breathing, Mom.
We are...
I'm tired now.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Not funny, Sam!
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Lucy.
I hope so.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Now you and David...
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
No.
Piss off.
Huh?...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
I know.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Watch Clark.
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
The dogs?
Look, I'm just guessing...
You been made, MacReady.
We ain't buying that.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Thank you.
Bennings?
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
Position, my ass...
Get your gear on.
MacReady, that you?
Yeah!
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
What happened?
I'm used to that.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Why is it -- breaking up?
Talk away, Professor.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Holding you... again.
No... let's walk through the city.
I've seen it.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
What?
How romantic...
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Then why are you here?
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Mm.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes.
Want to be a high climber now, do you?
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
How do you decide?
You liked it there.
Mara --
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
New Yorkers.
My father has gone to a better place.
They've gone to a better place.
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
No, sir.
Well, what are we gonna do about it now?
It's not my job to believe you.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
That's too bad.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
That's too bad.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
[Beat] What?
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
They're not.
[Beat] I don't know.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Believe me, I know.
[Beat] I don't know.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
This has nothing to do with that.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
Sure.
You like it?
I don't know, but I think part of it's...
You remember it?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
On what?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Tell us about him.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
What did ya do?
I'm a robber.
Tell me.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Christ, sure... yes!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
In the back?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
You're not touchin' that car.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
That's puttin' it mildly.
Have another drink, Thelma.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
You're right.
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
You do?
Are you alright?
What do you mean?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Good.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
How do you stay so positive?
Way up ahead!
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
I guess.
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Well... at least now you know.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Yeah feels like it.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Check.
People get hurt that way.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Call you back.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
The sawbones?
Pat Healy.
How'd you know that?
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
So you found Mary?
Oh. I thought  That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
You bet.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Bullshit!
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
I never said that.
Hm?
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Where's Puffy?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Oh, are you on the team?
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
We've got a lot in common.
Trying to be.
Yeah, sure.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Shhhhhh!
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
What about you? Where are you going?
Not as far as the election goes.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
You crashed my file?
Beats the hell outta me.
I already did.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
Yes.
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
-- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
Bullshit.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
You've got no jurisdiction.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
What'd you expect to hear?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
What are you talking about?
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Stop.
What?
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
We're going for The Stronghold.
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
That's right. Turn around.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Go ahead, Ray.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
I read, Cooch.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Do you want a coffee?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
How the hell do you know?
It is combat. Every second counts.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Uh hum.
What plane.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Make what?
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
What?
And now I want you.
I don't know yet.
Anything.
In that order?
Where'd you get it.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
How does it go?
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
And that's one!
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
What?  What is it?
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
I can recover. Hold on!
280, 290, 300 knots.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
So's my Johnson.
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Right.
What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
Time to go.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
That's because you don't have any women.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
Need a hint?
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
Just below ten thousand.
I've seen this before.
Some guys never get it back.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Then why are you here?
All right.
Or....
I know.
He was by the book, all the way.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
Oh, the usual.  More money, more freedom, more air.
You're getting off to an early start.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
I think my grampa might be here.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
Get it, please.
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Yes, sir.
What is it?
Why not?
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
Slim, athletic, voluptuous?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm listening.
That's right.
Yeah.
What, aliens?
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Melina!
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Up to the right.
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
What the hell is this?
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
Implanted.
Bullshit.
It's time you found out.
How real does it seem?
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Like what?
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
The reactor.
The one in the mine!
Ready as we'll ever be.
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
Roger that.
You can't fight'em that way...
I don't know...  They're pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
No.  We go straight.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Nestor's out of town tomorrow.  We don't dig today.  We don't get paid today.  Damn it, Valentine, you never plan ahead.  You never take the long view.  Hell, here it is Monday and I'm already working on Wednesday.  It is Monday, right?
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
I'll go with that plan.
I am not!
The rifle.
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Me, too.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
No ties.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
Yeah, Val.
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah, geography.
Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings.  I mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
I did five years in Attica. Lot of cons helped me in the joint. But I never got help from any lawyer... I built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else. "Art's Supplies" is for ex- cons. Not lawyers.
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
You can't remember that -- !
Ah.
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
Of course.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
That's why I hate experts.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
I embroidered.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
EXACTLY!
I don't need sleep!
Exactly what happened then?
But why?
It was self-defense.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
Argumentative.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
Albert.
Blonde.
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Here he comes.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
Well, where are you going?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Yep, it sure is.
Was there an argument?
Someone else has it now.
Say no more.
Thanks.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
I don't know, Sam.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
It's late, Sam.
She must have known someone.
Faulty wiring.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
You want a muffin?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
No, you should forget about last night.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Why do you do it, Laura?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Fill 'er up.
I haven't got it yet.
Maybe.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
What does Bob say?
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
You want to see...
You'd think so.
They were looking for wood.
We throw away the whole head.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Stay away from me.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
I'm fine.
How good's your intelligence?
...tell me about this case.
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
It looks that way.
You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
What book is that?
Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
Objection.
Huh!
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Yes.
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Tell me one?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
You ruined my life, Mister... Me and my wife... and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years.  Four years... my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
I am on the staff of...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Thank you.
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
...that's perfectly all right.
Hi. How are you doing?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
A single hour.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Ready, your Honor.
Defense...?
I'm a lawyer.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
What...?
Isn't there something you...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
No... no...
What are you going to do?
I can't guarantee that...
This is Miss Costello...?
Kathy Price.
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I didn't do it, Mister.
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
You use their witness.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What difference can that make...? All right...
What did she do?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
How'm I doing so far?
Should I?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Let's go.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Would you like some coffee, General?
It's gone now.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up.  You're still in command.  Clayton Forrester!  I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
You get any sleep last night?
Hasn't been another call, has there?
No.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Finish, please!
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Right.
A story?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
When do you think it'll be done?
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
What are you talking about?
Fred Krueger did it.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
They wouldn't let me...
That was Nancy, not me!
Choice?  What kind of choice?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Me too.
Not yet.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
You miss him.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
I haven't forgotten.
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
I didn't know sir.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
Thank you.
It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
Believe what?
Yeah.  How'd you do.
What about you?
What?
Figured what out?
Because it looks good.
It was a bad dream...
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
Good.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
Speak up boy!
Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
They have every right Chuck.
You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Then keep your mouth shut.
I don't know...
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
I am accountable.
Then what are you trying to say then?
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Y'all take American Express?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Why not?
This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
What is it?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
What's the name of it?
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Whattaya do there?
In many capacities.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
This 'bout the fifth time?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
We'll find out in a hurry.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
That'd be good, Lula.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Oh shit...
One bad car accident...
Yeah?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
Like hell.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Yes... Get rid of him.
Simple? Kill him? How?
That's your business... I don't care how.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Yes.
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
I know... I remember.
Actually... I just want to go home.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
He's right, you look horrible.
Isn't she?
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
Not Curtis.
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Only in your bones?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
So whose car is it?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
I peeked.
It's mine.
How long have you been having them?
I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
No, really...
'Fraid so.
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
With Emily?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It's not bad.
Well...
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
I'll miss my bus.
So I'm told.
What are we going to do with...
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Your aunt?
Colon cancer.
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
How can you tell?
Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
What?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I'm sorry.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
It beats 'What's your major?'
And? Are you going to tell him?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
I'm kidding. Hello?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
About the baby.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Inside.
I said it didn't sound like you.
I'm through improvising.
This is important.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
You want to keep him happy.
K through sixth.
I'm working on it.
It was a beautiful present.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
The birthday party.
Next week? The week after?
Don't talk like that.
You don't have to tell me this.
I don't like starlings.
How does it sound?
I bet you can.
You should hear the bird.
I have to go.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
Robin.
I could get a search warrant.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Little Red Riding Hood.
The girl.
No.
I went to bed around seven.
It's a free country, isn't it?
'Fraid not.
Why's that?
No.
No thank you.
Do you like it when he asks you?
What will happen if I do?
Will I see you again?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
It's all the same.
That's right.
No fucking way.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Will I ever be normal?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
I don't know.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
What?
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
I see my sister.
In my bed too.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Accept you?
I'm just quiet.
I get that impression.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
Hi.
Yeah.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
You really believe that?
And what do you tell yourself now?
What?
What odds?
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Fine.
I'm not scared.
Yeah.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
Not for long.
What happened?
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Yeah.  So sue me.
We've only got one suit.
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
What's the plan?
Tell me later.
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Wilhite, anything?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
What's the timer set for?
A little more so this time.
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
That seems to apply to you also...
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
No.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Yes, very much so.
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
So, you wonder why?
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
From Panarea. Why?
What boat?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
You really must do me this one favor.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
He loves you the way you are.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.
Why?
What do you mean?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Yes.
No I don't.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Oh, I know he does.
Where do you meet?
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Yes.
And what happened?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
Would you like to ask them?
Not at the moment, no.
I've stopped menstruating
One.
Like what?
Did your mother see angels often?
Is that what she said?
I breathed!
No...
She's dead isn't she?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
And that you're stupid?
And why am I here?
Because I'm in trouble.
Yes.
Will she be angry?
I'm afraid.
Hm hmm.
Someone's following me.
A crucifix.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
Why?
She'd seen him too.
From the belltower the day she before she died.
For what he made me go through.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
I don't remember.
You saw it all didn't you?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
What?  You think that the girl is innocent?
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
You have proof?
When?
I can get you new evidence next week.
Do you still go to church?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
I can beat that.
How did she hide it during the day?
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
Could there have been anyone else?
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are!  I don't want that mind cut open.
It's possible isn't it?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Not simple, no.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Aquittal.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Sister Paul?
Your niece!
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
I knew that after the fact.
Her spiritual health.
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Do you want to become one?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
I'm concerned about her health.
Was it you?
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Are you now?
Oh, it's all right.
You do - repeatedly.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
A butcher?
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
He's sulking again.
You crawler.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Aye, I knew you were.
The big hammer?
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
What are you?
Why selfish?
Pity.
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Have they?
Eh?
You see, sly villains.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
For Ringo.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
What's old got to do with it?
You wouldn't!
Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
Oh, leave off!!!
Aye, I suppose so.
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Good lad, Ringo.
But John hasn't got any.
Shurrup, cheerful.
Get knotted!
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.  Two hours.
I'll see what I can do.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
I'm on my way.
What is it, I can't --
God I'm hungry.
Unknown.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
It grows on you.
Dead.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
Well we better do something.
Right. 
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Boy, that's terrific.
Careful, don't get under it!
Good.
Got a better idea?
It's time for drastic remedies.
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
I can't, the acid will pour out!
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Three blips!  They're coming this way!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
In symbolic form... very stylized... but if you stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
It's not going to work.
Is it armed?
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
How far?
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
Who knows?
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Let's let the machine work on him.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
Maybe we could write it together.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
They're on the next level up.
Close...
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Turn on navigation lights.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
With great pleasure.
Food-storage room!
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
What did it do to you?
Look...
I'll get you out of there.
I told you we... what's that?
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Yep...
Better tell the boss.
Okay, give me the numbers.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
You win some, you loose some.
Force the door.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
What?
Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
Anything you say, Mammacitta.
Where does that lead to?
Okay.
Auto-shop?
Uh-huh.
Appreciate that.
Looks like it.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
I... I can't!
'Bout five minutes.
You got it, cowboy.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
You're more than modest.
Please do.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Eddie...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Stars.
Why not?
Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
I didn't mean just the Theater.
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
Because I don't want to.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Because that is what they are. Go make him happy.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
And too many of them are produced.
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
Maybe just a little around the edges.
I'll try.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
You're my girl, aren't you?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Many happy returns of the day...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
When I'm guest of honor?
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
I don't think that's funny!
Nothing, really...
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Now don't get carried away-
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
Why you have to go out there.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
You hear all kinds of things.
No thanks, Birdie.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
The same size?
Miss Coonan...
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Behind in your dues? How much?
Now you want an argument.
She's loyal and efficient-
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
What for?
It was for my report.
I might.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
My husband...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
It doesn't matter.
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
Check.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Don't joke about such things.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Not much.
Nothing...
- and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
To you, too?
That's beside the point.
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
Call, what call?
Go ahead, please...
I just played it.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
I said I'm a dying man!
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--see?--
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
'68.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we will--
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
Hmm?
Night.
I'm on deadline.
Mind if I try?
I've got a lot of energy.
I know where Dwight works.
Tell that to Muskie.
--what about you?--
Five hundred; six maybe.
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
I will not talk about the other two.
You asking me to disclose my source?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
--I'm not here.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Ratfucking.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
Government. Recently retired.
Where?
I think so.
Let me see what you get, but don't jump--The New York Times thinks it's crazy Cubans.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
-- Thanks, coach --
Sorry, coach.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
I'm not good in math.
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Neither did I!
Why is this?
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
Neither will I.
You don't like it?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
...yeah.
Yeah right.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
No.
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
That's stupid.
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
I know.  Hey Nadia.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Move with the music.
You think so?
You got in.
Tonight?
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
How?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
No...I know the perfect time...
Me too.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Dude, prom sucks.
Observe.
He didn't?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Bullshit.  From where?
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Just like sex with my wife.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Like an underground club?
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Are you okay?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
What?! He told you? When?
A cure?
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
What...?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
It's making me hungry.
Andy...
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
No... I...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Uncle Terrence.
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Are you crazy? We have nothing. Let him go, then watch him. If you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. Or maybe he'll lead you to the others. Just let him go.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
I know, but I had to because . . .
Then come find me.
I'm fine.
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
No!
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Sad?
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
How do you know?
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
No. Empress, you --
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Come on.
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Lyndon Johnson?
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
No, Chippewa Falls.
Uh, you're driving a-
Well, where is it? I-
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Huh?
Well...
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
No.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
U-huh.
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
Do I love you?
Yeah.
Of course.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Uh-uh-why?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
What?
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
What?
W-w-whatta you mean?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Yeah.
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
Nothing at all?
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
This is the first book that I got you.
What?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
I thought just earplugs.
This is my room.
Why are you so hostile?
Oh, you got a headache!
Oswald and ghosts.
Tsch, a few.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V.P.L.?
And... uh-
Yeah. Right.
His wife has diabetes!
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
No.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Very well.
Why didn't you come in?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
Why would she care?
It's not going to come up.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Can I open it?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Harry called.
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Anytime, sport.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Did you invite them?
Did he promise?
Beats a lawsuit.
We're great.
I mean, you're really back.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
It's taken care of.
Well he can't have gone far.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
It's not like this all the time.
It's a novel.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Me too.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
Ah...
Oh, Sally Mae...
Come on, Panes...
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
Don't be silly.
Ah.
Ah there's our snookums now.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Sally did all this herself?
I'm a little nervous, so...
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Very well put.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
That's a lot of those.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
Come here.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
I'm sure you understand.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people...
Are you working on a new book?
No, no thanks.
That was my clue.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
Okay.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Well, so glad you decided to come.
I'll be right out.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
I hope they're watercolors!
She's such a great photographer.
Hm.
I thought it was okay where it was.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
And the food sucks, I know.
Oh honey, let's.
Neither does Joe.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Well...  I declared war!
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
Yes.
How should <u>I know</u>?
I order you to find out where we are!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Well...no, but --
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Of course not --
You did?
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Oh, no, sir!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...Not enough food?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah.  How much?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
No.
Would you like to?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
No. Like a man.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
How is your cold?
How come?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You're so right.
No -- I like it.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
I think so.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
I'll fix you some coffee.
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Something wrong with your legs?
Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head. 
Thanks for reminding me.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
Sure.
I don't want it.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Sure.
Gin.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
A what?
In the knee?
What?
Fine. How's your eye?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I guess so.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
That's very wise.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Think.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
You better.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
I am?
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
No!
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I have a vague idea.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Me?
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
What about him?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
Family?
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
No.
A.W.O.L.?
That's right.
I missed you, Fran.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Handle what?
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Merry Christmas.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Yeah --
What !
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
One for all -- all for one --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Moonby what?
We do.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Yes, sir --
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I don't know.
How much is left?
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there.
God knows.
Yeah, I know.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Shot himself. What for ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
While you were sleeping.
Looks pretty shallow.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Yeah, it still runs.
Charlie?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
What do you mean?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
The enemy. Who else?
No -- no, sir.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
What Truth?
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What are you doing?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I was on threshold of great things.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You think he'd of shot us?
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
No -- leave it --
What is this bridge?
Why did they attack us?
You're Australian?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
Right now -- I am.
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
23   CONTINUED:  
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
175  CONTINUED:
How did she..?
No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
It's exactly what you meant.
Come here...
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
That's right.  You're not.
Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Forget it.  It would take days.
How many do you see?
You don't know how true that is.

Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Nothing personal.
If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
They'll have to come right past us.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Okay.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Carol the waitress?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Lovely.
I want you to go on this trip.
No, sir...
You take off when you have to.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
And?
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Okay.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
Never.
I'll never forget you said it.
It was a mistake.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Grouchy?
I had to see you...
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
What a nice compliment.
No!!!
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
Thanks for looking after him.
He's a pain in the ass.
What?
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
How're you doing?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Where are all your queer party friends?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Yeah...
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Does it matter?
Picking on me won't help.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Right.
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Sounds like chickenshit --
What does that fucking mean?
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
Yes, sir.
Paid in full.
Where are we going?
Now you understand why I'm here.
Someone hired both of you?
Yes.
And you want to use me to get him?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Electra.
Better than playing with yourself.
The C.I.A.?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
The exotic women.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Why?
After that?
No.  Something honest.
You were there?
Here?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
How was the beach?
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Yes.  Here I am again.
So?
I didn't notice them.
Did you --
When did it start?
I waited another four minutes.
Shit.
Last night --
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Electra --
A pleasure doing business with you.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Shit... oh well.
Taken.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
Thank you.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Like you?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
He was an electrician?
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
No beer?
You're all bloody useless.
What happened to Katka?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
You capitalist pig!
That bad?
So I hear.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
Sure I'm sure!
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Yes.
No!
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Sure. Excellent.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
What?
No.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
I hope so!
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
Not this time, Kat.
Sure, I've done it easily.
It's not so much.
Don't worry. Thanks.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Will this thing take long?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
Sure!
Alright!
And you broke into that room?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
Yeah!
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No way, he even gave me back pay.
All the more reason to eliminate him.
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You're fine like that, Mom.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Late night.  You?
You sleeping with her?
I meant he's a doctor.
Landon --
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
-- This your idea of small talk?
You don't know me.
This play -- ?
No. Not like you.
And you have to meet my father.
The world of the dead?
In 76 years, me neither.
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You don't miss a thing.
Then maybe you can read mine.
Prove it.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
You're sometimes not sure?
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
What do you actually know with religion?
I was twelve.
In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
That won't be possible.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Yes. You?
She did. It was you.
I'd do that --
Where did you get -- ?
You came here to give me my report card?
Yeah.
Are you?
No....
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
That's good.
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
Pro, the sun's out!
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Is Shemp all right?
So what? We'd be rich!
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
You know me?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Dick? Dick who?
I run this place! 
What happened to Dick Wilson?
Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
No way!
He said not to tell.
You don't mind?
Okay.
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Tom...
Thanks.
Yeah? Why not?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Okay.
No.
What for?
Nah, I got me a job.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
Yeah, me too.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
It was going too fast.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
What?
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Stay as long as you like.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
What?
Planet 10?
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Now!
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
I wish he was.  He's real enough.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
I have a radio fix...
John Whorfin will kill us!
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
I didn't drop 'em.
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  please call me Barton.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
...I know this must look... funny.
No, no 
No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
What else?
So be it.
Well... actually, no Bill...
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
And what would that be, son?
What's that?
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
I need help, Audrey.
Well I...
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Go ahead, son.
What do you mean, Barton?
Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
What a dump...
No... Can I come in?
Hold on 
Hold on 
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
I'm at the Earle.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week  that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
Lou.
Congratulations.
Must be.
Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
Excuse me?
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Yeah.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Well, some of his throat was there.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
Give you nose bleeds?
No.
Home. Watching TV.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
She said what you said she'd say.
Sometimes I really hate you.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
Yes.
Yes.
Are you arresting me?
Why not?
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
No.
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
Yes.
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I'll risk it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I don't have a choice.
No.
Did you miss me?
No.
I told you.  She kills him.
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
No thank you.
No.
Routine.
That's him.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Say what?
Why not?
Catherine told me what was in it.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Is he dead?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Fuck you, too Nick.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Ignorant art?
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah  I'd do that... You could teach me.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Sure.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
I'm not black.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
About what?
I ain't John Henry.
Good.
Good. What do you have?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Drugs??!
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
Don't you think he's using you?
What's that about?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Stand still.
Have a Mac.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
5:11.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't know.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I'm -- sorry, I --
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
Maybe you're right.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Photojournalist.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Too good?
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Thanks.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Women.
You'd be surprised.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
Just the beast.
From the other side of the equator-
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
You lie!
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
What do you mean?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Our work?
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
She has an excellent mind.
Actually, he took the car.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Tonight's a good night.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Slanta.
Just ones this beautiful.
She's a Malaysian dream warden. She stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  Need one?
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
What do you want me to say? That I'm not attracted to him?
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
...Not the bat?
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Here. Get a good seat.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
Shouldn't we --
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
What did you see?
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
Maybe we should just kiss.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
... Where are you calling from?
Hang on. I have to leave a message.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Because I want someone I can trust.
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
What were you thinking?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
There aren't hotels?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Did you really ask?
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
What happened?!!!
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Isn't it?
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Great - keep him out of trouble.
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
David?
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
A car sounds sensible.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Why thank you sir.
Of course he is.
This sucks.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
What's your problem Beavis?
Turd-burglar...
Dill-wad...
Um... ass... head...
Uh... butt-snatch...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Uh, Butt-Head.
You'll be rich!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
... Hmmm?
Maybe this is heaven.
They make gypsies look good.
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Little black party dresses?
3:30 I guess.
We were trying to scare your mother.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
No.  What's wrong?
<u>Out</u>.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
What do you expect?  You're dead.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Your qu...?  But you're...
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
Gooood!
Attic space.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
I don't know.
I see.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I will.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
Yes, I suppose that's true.
In a day or two, yes.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I have no idea...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
He does...?
Good night, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Yes. That could be true.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Yes. I like to watch.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Do you think so? Do you think so?
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
I understand.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Yes.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
... Sir?
Yes.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
I agree.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Yes. I've seen that done.
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...  ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance...  But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...  ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?  ... Goodbye, Chance...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Since you were a child?
No.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
Now, Ben, did you happen to get a chance to...
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
Good night.
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Right, Chief.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
I'm afraid so.
Okay.
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
May 11th.
Hi.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
You bastard.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
People make mistakes.
I know.
That... was... no... simulation.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Is that true?
Who told you?
Yeah. But enough about me.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Vegas? What'd you think?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Who needs dancing?
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Whatever you're having.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
What want ye, girl child?
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
THE WHITEFOLK?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Don't pay to complain.
You on your way home?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Ya think?
But mama..
I know Denver.
He's sleeping in the church.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Till she showed herself.
I run him off.
You?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
No, You looking good.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
She left me. She's gone again.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Make it the way I always do.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah, okay.
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
It's the LeBaron.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
The?  Who the fff--
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
And this guy peed on it.
What--
That fucking bitch!
It's already posted.
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
No--
Am I wrong?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already.  Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking troubles are over, Dude.
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.
Yeah man.
Thank you.
And please don't call her my mother.
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well...no, of course not--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Yeah, but--
Huh?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
MARK IT ZERO!
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
What if it's during a game?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us!
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
No, I'm--
Uh-huh.
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Yeah?
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
They shot Donny!
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Yeah.
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Bunny.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Well. . . yeah.
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Survival.
Minutes.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
I don't think so.
Not good.
Where the hell have you been?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
Nomak?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
It worked, didn't it?
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
There is no cure.
You don't know that.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Cancer.
You don't look so good.
What are you talking about?
I know. Take some of my blood.
No --
For them. But for me --
You don't have to be.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
What happens then?
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
You've been listening in the whole time?
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
What do you mean?
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
What're you doing there?
Sometimes. Where are we going?
I guess--
--I'm not staying here!
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
--scared the living shit out of us.
--bullshit!
--you should get back into bed.
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
Both. Now.
No.
I don't know yet.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Shut-up.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
Butt-ugly owl.
--Cotter: shut up.
Just go.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
--things got a way of finding <u>you</u> here.
Goes right along with these two.
--who?
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
I am.
Fine.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
<u>What</u>?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Not planning on sleeping at all.
No. I don't think so.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Motion. Stop there. Play it again.
Okay.
....I don't know.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
That's why she kills children.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
Heather.
Yeah.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
She's far from "fine."
Anna--
--it's urgent!
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Your mother's pastor.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Abby--
I said you're bad.
...What do you mean?
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
I don't follow baseball.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Yeah.
How long did you watch her?
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
I want you to go fishing.
Ya catch any fish?
Right. Sorry.
This.
For what?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Okay honey.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. cheers.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Yeah. I get it.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes sir.
Baby wants to fuck.
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
If you want to.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Then you got undressed.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Lie down on the bed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
See my nipples?
Then don't talk about killing.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Yeah. hurry up though.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Falling.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Sure I do.
Yes.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
I'm glad you do.
I think I better go.
What?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Nothing.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yes.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yes. I do.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Yeah. but.
Oh, okay. can I call?
Are you sure?
Okay, okay. Bye.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
What am I going to do?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You like mysteries that much?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Really?
NO.
Frank!!
Yes.
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Hey Jeff.
Good deal Dad.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
... Stop it Mike.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Derek!
What is?
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
I see.  How much?
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
No?
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
Ah, yes.  The murder.
What kind of project?
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
But you must.  It's the only way.
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
You fucked me, Diego.
I talked to Foreal, Diego.
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
In how long?  A week?
Today.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Mom.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
I want money.
Family.
Diego is my brother.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Good.
Tuna.
I said, I've seen it before.
Out.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah.
Are we gonna split up?
Shhhh.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
The strike is a success; but ...
Don't move, Hacene.
It's true.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
Let's try ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
No, and neither were my men.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
So -- where do we start?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Cause?
That's what my report will read.
What did they argue about?
You may call your next witness.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Why did you come by?
Thank you.
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
She was.
-- And what did you suggest?
No.
No.  No, I don't.
Oriental medicine.
Why does she come to you?
Yes -- quite easy.
High school?
No.
Yes -- he did.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What happened?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
You didn't know about it before that?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
No pain, no gain?
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Really?
Of course.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
You don't need anybody.
Shoot him.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
You better.  Please answer the question.
This is not relaxing.
Some example you set.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
SO!
Doesn't matter. Move on.
What problem?
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Come here a minute.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Nobody did.
She used to be so friendly.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
That's it.
Maybe it's because I live here.
And how long are you here for?
And clean.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Why did you stop?
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Do you want to leave your husband?
I already apologized.
Wonderful. Uh...
Yes.
Near the church.
No, I don't mind.
Well, what is this?
How do you know what I experience?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
For who?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
Sure.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Betty.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
I don't remember!
Well, close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
He yours, sir?
Keep smokin', fool.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
That's some terrible shit.
Bones.
What it will be.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
You know I can't.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
Please.  It's for your own good.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Lucky thing.
The dead get out?
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
Not that I remember.
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
Where is it?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
But you know he did it.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Where, then?
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
I had to.  You made me.
Good boy.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
This is the police, ma'am.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
Truck.  Of course.
I knew it.
Oh, really.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
What do you want?
A beer?
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
No.
Basically.
I'm already in your bed.
Nothing.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
Work.
You mean Shelly?
For what?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
What happened?
What did Gino drink?
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Trust me, Violet.
Thank you.
I won't.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
I was so afraid you ...
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
You have your passport?
Yeah, I know...
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Excuse me?

-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
Then I'll find another ride.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
Looks familiar?
...omigod, no...
He came to kill us.
-- how? --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
What about you?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
This your store?
-- don't sweat it, I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
So now you're asking for a student visa?
Hang on... 
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
Where am I?
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
...elephoned sir.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
...sabotage!
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Jack!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How do you mean?
Very smart.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Trust me.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
Bastard!!!
Who are you?
Why?
It does doesn't it?
Where are you taking me?
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
You're joking.
Cut it out, Sam.
Turn!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Where are you going?
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Really.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
You are good to me Sam.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sam Lowry.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
What have you done with his body?
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
I know, I know ...!
I ... uh ...
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
But I could be anybody.
Numero, trois.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
She say she in great pain.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Mary said you might be coming.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
Sure, sure, give go.
Oh man, Bucky.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
Yes.
Did you see my father?
He's working a double shift.
I think it looks good.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
What's that, Frank?
Backup?
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
I'm not hungry.
You sure?
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
They booted me out of Washington.
Hold it down, okay?
I'll see you back at the hotel.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Why?
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
I don't like the word gay.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
Stop it.
Wipe me out?
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
Yes.
It's started.
Should I...
Just a two-second dissolve.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
...good-bye then.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
Why so glum?
It's not.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes, sure.
So great -- right?
How are you at back rubs?
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
Okay.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
Yeah?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
What?
Yes.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Okay...It's so good to see you.
I can't be.
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Yeah.
Is the manager cooperating?
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Well I can't say that Walter!  She's incomparable.  They're both great.
Of course I do!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Hm.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I admit it.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
I know.
Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
Enough already about it - get to work!
Well...
I don't have another cat!
You didn't mean to what?
You might talk too much.
Put it down, Walter.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
You're like an undercover guy!
C-connection?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
Good morning Walter!
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Why not?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
If you see him.
What's the matter with you!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Bummer metaphor.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Which way did she go?
My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
Jealous?
I do?  I guess I do.
'Bye.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I think you've forgotten something.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
I know.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Who?
For the dance.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Get a boob job.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
All right.
It's true.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Sporting events, yeah.
No -- you don't have to --
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me.
All right.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
I was just scared is all.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Why?  Why me?
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Okay, what else?
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
But --
Okay.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
He is so bald.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Well, look who's here.
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
Except for Prom.
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Switch nostrils?
It's all the same thing.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
I know what it is.
I did.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
What do you believe in?
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
You're pulling your hips out.
You okay?
Annie---
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
You got a live arm there.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
But he ain't seen my heat--
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
No.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
She's playing with my mind.
We'll be praying for you.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Ain't he warning up?
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
We're eight and sixteen.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I'm getting too old for this game.
It's a damn convention.
Where does he go?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
What?
What are you talking about?
Why are you doing this to me?
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
Yeah.
Hold on a second.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
All right.
Nope, there's no way.
Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
All right, fine.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
My wife?
...to me.
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
No, a...
What people?
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
It's me.
No, that's quite all right.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
We can't get rid of him?
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Right away. Okay?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
What?
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Listen...
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
What'd you have?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
You fuckin' whore!
You understand? What? Let you go?
Get - get up!
I'm not -
Mr Rothstein.
You're firin' me?
Can you do it with your left hand?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Shut your mouth!
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
Pitch-black?! It -
You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
He tries to do everything...
He's gone?
Carmine's gone.
Carmine left?
Fine, fine.
Of course, Remo.
He's good. He's fine.
Mm.
Yeah.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
You're so nice. 
Yeah?
Let me think about that.
You know?
Is that what you want?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
Ginger, honey.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Come on! 
Yeah.
No, Lester.
He called you right here.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Yes, don't worry.
Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?
Two?
Remo.
They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
You're a little confused?
Denying?
Mr. Chairman -
Again!
I'm sorry.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
Yeah.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
You're probably right.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
I lied.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
What little boy doesn't?
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
A bit sadistic, don't you think, Captain...?
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Oh now this one is mine...
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
You turned around!
Like you don't know...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Uh-huh..
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
I didn't hurt you.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
It's taken care of.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
If you know that just back off.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
You don't understand.
And what're you whispering for?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
You won't disconnect.
Then hang up!  Do it!
Shit!
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Sometimes I paint.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
Your husband?
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Damned if I know.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
L.A.P.D.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
You, I would've noticed.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Who is this?
What time frame have you got in mind?
Sure.
308-9962.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
You should've done all this before.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
I'm backing up.
Call me "Nels."
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Seems not.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Hold on.
Whatever you say.
See what, Dil?
Persistent.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
Where?
Half-five. At Millie's.
They're jealous.
Yes.
Are you jealous of him?
Yeah.
Apologies, my sweet.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Sure I do.
Shut up.
You think that's wise?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
A little.
Don't be cruel.
Not at all, honey.
Yes.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.
Afraid so.
You got the keys to the shop?
What?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Jimmy?
Don't you want to kill me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Tell me you love me.
Anything.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Can't.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
He's hot.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
I sincerely hope so.
Do you want a cup of tea?
Why would you do that?
It's your decision.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
Yeah.
Can't.
Am I?
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
She your wife?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
I'll bear that in mind.
Hurry up, would you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
What?
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Faster than cricket?
Hurling --
You don't know me, do you?
Who gives a fuck.
People. They could be looking.
He believes in the future --
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
What are you talking about?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Well -- come on.
Can you remember anything at all?
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Barely, yes.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Bartholomew?
Open it.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
I'll take that.
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
What are you doing?
Or Tex?
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
What's so illogical about that?
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
What's its value today?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Flix -- are they for sale now?
Here's ten.
You know I'd tell you if I had it.
The kid said --
Tell me what?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
I'm very cold.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
Good for you.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Where?
On the street where you live.
How about once more around the park?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Be careful, Peter.
That's all.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Wha -- what do you want?
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Who invited you?
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So?
It won't happen again.
I'm not.
She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
No I wasn't.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No. I'll handle this.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I can.
No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Ok.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
Sure.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
No!
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Follow me.
You Miss Dunlop?
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
They're not picking me up until six.
I'm making you feel like meat?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
That's what he said.
Not that I know of.
Don't make me order you.
Attacked how?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
I'm worried about someone.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Okay, okay.

I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
How wonderful for you.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
To tell you the truth, you didn't.

Hello.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
No.
That's bullshit.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.

Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Yeah.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.
We're worried...
Listen, shithead!
...without compunction.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
Thank you.
However, you are also non-en-...
I'd say we're about even.
Is it--?
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
You look fit...healthy...

Is that why you're here?  To blame...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
All right.  After they put you away...
Brynner.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
Check the immediate area.
You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  I think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.

That's right.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--

Yes, sir, that's what it looks like. I'll give you that.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
I've got her.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Just bring your checkbook.
Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
But what?
How are you, Lou?
I'd like to talk to him.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
Or her name?
No. It was an accident.
Didn't you call?
I don't.
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
I heard it was an accident.
Too late for what?
Where?
What's the maid's address?
Well, let's go.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
No.
Do you know where she might be?
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
That's not his apartment.
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I'll stop by.
Well, how much would you like?
But he wasn't killed.
My husband.
I was grateful.
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
She's cheating on him.
I don't believe you.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Oh, yeah?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Is that unusual?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
What were you doing there?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
It has to do with my father.
I know.
You mean she just found out?
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
To Mexico...
...so that's why you hate him...
Sophie.
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
You'll find one of those people.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Then go home and forget about it.
But...
Yeah.
Gittes.
How did they get it away from him?
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up.  It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
What does it say there?
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
You don't really think so?
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Hello, Bernstein.
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
Ask them to sit down.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
Hmm!
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I work at Seligman's.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You can't stop me.
I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
Yes, sir. 
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Yes?
Charlie -
Charlie!
Look out that window.
I'm drunk.
Brad, you are drunk.
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
I had a toothache.
He married you, didn't he?
What about that apartment?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
Am I sure?
Are you sure?
You're shittin' me.
You think I'm shitting you...
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
There's no light back there.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Awww. That was so cute.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
How do you know that?
How like her.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Look how full of yourself you are.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Sang.
I'm not fooling around!  Who went back there?
What time was this?
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Yeah.
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
"Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
Yeah.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
We get... what... twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
What do you two fight about?
That's cheating?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fianc.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Empire.
All right, Vader's boss...
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
It would stand to reason, yes.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And you figured it out?
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
I told him that and he yelled at me.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Why not?
Veronica!
Can you believe this?!
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
You hate people.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
I can't close the store.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
You know.
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
I never tried it.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
I don't want to talk to you.
You want to rent a movie.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
And this is what you rented?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
Thirty-seven.
Leave me alone.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
I don't have love handles.
Jesus Christ, what next?
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
He died in the bathroom.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
You're trusting.
Really?
"Be there?"
And I actually date you?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
Including you; yes.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
Please calm down.
This is different. This is important. How many?!
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
I don't want to go back with her...
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
Yeah!
I... I don't know what to say.
I'm not sad.
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
I copy.
Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
The clip's not gonna hold!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
My pleasure.
Sure you can.
That's it, you look like a professional.
I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Where've you been?
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Resuscitation?
Where?
I only came back for you.
Don't worry about me, just go.
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
And miss all of this peace and quiet?  Never, right Hal?
Right, all the bullets we can eat.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
It looks like a winding route.
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Ask the questions.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
What did you do that for?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Of course. Food alright?
Great, sir. Great.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Hullo love, how are you?  Nice to see you, Dad.
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
I did, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
I'm gonna be sick.
You wanna be sick?
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
Murder, sir.
No, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Good. What do you want?
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Sixth is faster.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Of course.
I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
I think...
Wouldn't dream of it.
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Try?
I got caught up at work.
I'm standing right here.
Let's not get excited, sir.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
You mean like benefits?
I'm cool.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
What?
It's a mess.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
I didn't throw him, he fell.
How can you kill him like that?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Yeah.
What?
I'm not catching a melody.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
No, not just that.
What's at Union Station?
There you go...!
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's what you said...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Then what are you?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
Slow down.
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Why the hell not?
The guy came right at us!
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Do you still ride?
I think you're different.
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
Switch the charts.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
I can't promise you anything.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Nothing is easy.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Pretty scary, huh?
Never heard of him.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Not this again.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Right here in Manhattan.
Okay, I will.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
This way.
What's in Connecticut?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Don't do this.
You've never seen her run.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
What the hell does that mean?
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Your call.  Have a good night.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
I disagree.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
David --
What?  Why?
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
It'll just take a moment.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Could we hear to the moon?
We thought this might make things a little easier.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
No more stalling, Captain.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
That's my girl.  Done.
Sounds like a Russian general.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
Any luck on the grant money?
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
And?
Actually --
We could be together again --
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Spoken like a true believer.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Now you know.
Can you try?
Did you love him?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
It's getting late...
I'm sorry.
What?
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
-- I don't know --
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Tramp! Beautiful!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
A Lucas Jackson.
Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
Innocent?
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's what you're gonna have to do.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Take it easy, Drag.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Like I always do?
You just said he could eat anything.
Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
You phony creep!
Fear of what...
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
About what?
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
The door was already open...
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
In jail.
Who?
Because of your phone calls.
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
For months... last October.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
I'll get a locksmith.
Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Over here.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Who came in after you?
I like women like that!
Right.
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
How about I put Nikko on it?
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
One of your suitors?
I'd like to go back. James...
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
No.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Yes.
I did this already.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
And the party?
Oh, no, of course not.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
Who do you think you are?
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
No.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
I wish I could have seen that.
I don't like lamb.
Your family just met me.
But I do.     I love you, too.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
List schmist. You'll remember.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
I love your apartment.
Really?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Sounds grim.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Are you OK?
How about a dance?
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
And all the plans we have.
What do you want to do?
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
She's only known the guy a few months.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
That's a big question.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
A pass.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
You're there now?
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
No thank you.
I'm good.   Really.
Why are you here?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
He missed three weeks.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
I only have your word for that.
Because you're the closest.
And the Vodka.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
Why haven't you turned us in?
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
A thousand dollars?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
I just thought that--
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
What'd they take?
Everything.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Go look.
Oh yeah.
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
You lived there. You know the city.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
Yeah.   It's mine.
I know where she went.
Oh, you think?
What?
Wait here.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
Stick around and find out.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
A car.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Shut up!
I owe you nothing.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
Long.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Jen...
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
So what will you do now?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
But don't be too lenient.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
I should be trying to stop you.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
You gotta go now, I bet.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Right.
Very well, it's your ass.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
What'cha reading?
That's a matter of opinion.
Refreshing.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I'm busy.
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
I can't win with you.
Lighten up.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Where are you going?
Good for you.
Get off me.
I love you.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Greg McConnell.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Okay.
Best friends.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
Well did you like it?
You think he'll like it?
I want to go home.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
I do.
It works a little.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
I'm pretty sure she did.
I'll be in touch.
I told you I don't know.
I'll be right there.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
You don't mean?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
I'm working on it.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Mock, mock, mock.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
I'll do my best.
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Do you know where she is?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Don't worry about it.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
What do you mean?
At the old house with the voice.
The Farren house
She was very pretty.
I know that.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Yes, darling,
I think I should.  3000W?
That's right.
Well, it seemed to me --
Well, you know where it is.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Did you mail then?
Certain wishes do.
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy, it's true.
Let me be the judge of that.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
I've wanted a friend.
For as long as you'll let me.
Your children?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
That's a fine-looking ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
Then I'll tell you a story  a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Good.
Yes, yes -
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
I mean where on your body?
It's not just in my head.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
No it's mom.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Maybe they have to pee.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Benito.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
It's stupid.
No, she died when I was twelve.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Interesting possibility.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Take some allergy medicine.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
He's seriously disturbed...
Loose ends?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
Yes, sir.
Fine.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Put it through...
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Why are they after you?
Water?
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right.  I <u>am</u> your doctor.
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
How do you know I'm innocent?
Don't worry.
For a month.
) Listen, you little...
Share...
Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Fine.
... What?
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Mild stroke?
I was a senator, you know.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
What do you mean, he's clean?
Clean.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
He's only doing what you told him to.
Dave...
Certainly.
Yeah.
What?
I can't say.
Oh.
No... They don't kid.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Thanks.
Yes.
I know. I'm sorry...
... Me, too.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
That sounds like a curse to me.
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
Datura.
What?
A direct hit'll blow the top off this whole island! How're you gonna fuse the stuff? How're you gonna leave yourself time to get out?
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
Let me see your weapon.
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
I'm alright. Let's go.
To fucking Mutt.
Will do.
Women swoon!
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
Yeah.
I'll tell you later.
Isn't he precious?
I think you're sweet.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
You're welcome to join us, Todd.
All right.  I'll second that.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Knox?!
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
A crazy madman.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
But father, it's not fair.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
I... I just don't want to come.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I will be with thee straight.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
And no questions asked.
I have a schedule...
You're going to have to get a new one.
Shut up!
On the side!!
Yeah...
And what if I run into one of those things?
I don't take orders at all.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Me??
I'm stuck...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
I have been.
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
A passenger...
Like Mamooli's country...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
She fucked you?
Who's going?
It's Nick!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Where? Where is he?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Get anything?
You know a guy named Merle?
Yeah?
Inside, Vince.
No?
Here.
Linda, what's the matter?
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Okay.
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Hey. Look. There must be something.
That way it sets.
So do I.
What do you think about?
Yeah.  When it comes to hunting, that's true.
From Nam?
You got it.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Forget Sal.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
No way. No fucking way!
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
You guys are crazy. You know that? I mean you guys are really nuts.
Great. That's great.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
That's who.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
No.
No!
I think he wants more than your cookies.
I'm going to kill you when this is all over.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
That wasn't your plan, was it?
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
How then?
Hey, I'm eating.
Then find me some cigarettes.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You treat her nice.
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
Jabez! Careful --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
And serve him right!
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
I did not, Grandma.
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
Where's everybody?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
He was --
My time isn't up yet.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Why of course --
You're right, Mary.
Yep.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
You'll never change -- will you?
Thanks, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
It shows on your face.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Me -- a son.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
I guess we won't.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Hullooo!
Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
And if he alters it...?						*
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Put it down now.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Bullshit.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
No.  I never smile any more.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Oh, yeah, I will...
I love you.
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
I'm really shakey.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Shit...
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Look... don't throw that on me.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
You said a mouthful... sweetheart!
What kind of things, Leon?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Give me the keys...
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I'll be God damned if you will.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Yeah.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
I want him to think that.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Does that still go?
I never been up in a plane before.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay, Sonny.
I want to talk to Leon.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
Gimme the black guy...
Open this up!
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
For the love of God. Not Spanish again. Who's the girl?
What about your toe?
Yes.
<i>What is it?</i>
I don't know. They might be dead already.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Take us to Vegas.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
Must you use that awful word?
Cunt.
I said stop it.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
I was a musician.
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
I be.  I'm living large.
Is that the only tape you got?
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
I own a brownstone on this block.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Did you ask Sal?
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
You're a drunk fool.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
OK.  OK.
That's it?
What makes Sammy run?
I'm working.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
Nice!
Innocent!
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
And move to Long Island...
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Can you pay me now?
C'mon, Sal.
We both do.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Keep it.
Christmas came early.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Come in then.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Shit!  I forgot.
I can run out and get it.
How long then?
Then we'll do something else.
Trust me.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Tina, it's not like that.
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
What?
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
I don't know.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Here, take the broom.  The front needs sweeping.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Four colors? Neato!
You did?
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Coming.
What? No! Look.
No, it's a treasure map.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
You take that back!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Sucks for you.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
A blimp.
Who?
Am not.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
I lugged it all over town!
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
I don't know who we are anymore.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
And with that complete loser
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
You mean the lunch room?
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
And, Ching Chong, you're not a Special Needs kid. You're just a foreign exchange student.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Looks like the best man won.
"My dream date with Principal Collins."
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
He passed away three years ago.
Have you got what I want?
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Piter.
I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...
I'm sorry Gurney.
The Emperor's blade.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
Your Reverence.
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
Yes...
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Why do they come?
Pain.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
They tried and died.
Those sounds could be imitated.
Thank you.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
I have no next picture.
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
The <u>women</u>?
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
I don't understand.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
Of course!
Dracula?
I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
I never said I could ad-lib...
Mmph?  Where am I?
Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Really?
So why didn't you do it?
Formaldehyde.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
This is the big moment...!
These shoes are itchy.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
I don't know.  It's so much money...
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Tits.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
And you did a bang-up job, too.  But you don't want other producers to know that's you in drag.  Trust me. It's a career killer.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
I like to wear women's clothes: Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it's just something I do. And I can't believe I'm telling you, but I really like you, and I don't want it getting in the way down the road.
My chiropractor!
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Let's get married.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Lines around the block.
Yeah...?
I'm directing.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah, so... ?
No.
Al!
Al!!
Where is she? Is she all right?
Yes!
You're nuts.
Okay, I'm nuts.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Ed --
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Who?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
No.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
Holy sh--
Who?
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
She left.
No, I mean...
Never would be plenty.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Why do it?
Really?
Yeah, well...
Saturday, I think we should
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Twenty-nine.
Are you all right?
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
Ray --
Oh, Jesus.
Great.
You brought the girl!
Cassie...
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Hi.
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
No.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You guys have fun?
Dick... Dick,..
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
But, Mr. M. -
Thanks, Mr. M.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
I'm looking at new cars.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Why are you doing this?
My house.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
Which door?
I don't believe you.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Dave.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Okay, let's say
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
And 290 "disregards," right?
If you say so.
Larry, you just take it easy
What...?
These are private -- these are for us.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Hell, good luck!
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
I'm not sure.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
I'm not asking you.
No.
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
More or less.
Say what and so what.
Say what?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Answer yes or no.
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
She may still be alive, whoever she is.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
Give me a minute, will ya?
You make a mistake?
Yeah.  My whole life.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Of his penis, sir?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
Why?
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
Where is he?
All he found were rodents.  No signs of foul play.  So there.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Down around my ankles.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
And Reynolds?
Yes.
Nothing.
I don't know what that means.
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Who are they?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I mean did you call anyone.
You told me no calls.
It really is.  Did you find anything?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Why?
I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
Yeah, I can see where that'd--
Tell me about it.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
How fast can you learn?
Well then who can?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Yes. I have her permission.
Thanks.
The robbery.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
Yeah.
I've seen it.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I know.
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
Yes.
Who?
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Why would I--
He doesn't work that way.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
That's temporary.
Bullshit.
Tell me about Brill.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
This conversation's over.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
I'm sorry about that.
Yeah.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
I don't under--
Oh, well, that's true.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
You're firing me.
Really?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
They killed Rachel.
Rachel's dead?
Bobby--
Why would they--
You gotta--
He got hit by a bus.
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
Get it.
Hiding something?
He had help.
I just meant--
If they've looked at the video.
Explain that.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
And if it wasn't?
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
What do you mean, poetry?
Ask Al Auf. Almsy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
Oh my God, the others!
No.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Do you have your papers, sir?
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
No.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Are you Hana?
What do you want?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
Who are his ghosts?
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
Oh, all over.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
No, now I can't kill you.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
That's a different dress.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Hey! -

I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Hello miss.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I had a hotel room.
This is making me incredibly angry.
No.
This was your garden?
Bingo.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I can't?
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Excuse me?
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Not funny.
We're only going one way.
What's my problem? You want a list?
And--
It's---beautiful.
Terrified. Still am.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Four billion dollars.
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
They drive so recklessly there.
Get out of here!
And you do it so well.
It's never big enough.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Because it pays off.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
I figured that out.
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
You're a lawyer?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Cause of the chromium.
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Excuse me?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Course I did.
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
What, you think I'm made of money?
That's crazy -- why not?
Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
<u>No</u>.
They skipped that step.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
And, what, I'm not serious?
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Take it.
Yesterday.
Corey.
And ...?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
I don't know.
So did I.
When?
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Cause I don't even know you.
How?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
I'm gonna clean it up.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
Nothing.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Yeah.  Who are you?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
You're moving away?  When?
Wow, that's soon --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
The Emperor?
Soon, Lord Vader.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
Right.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Barks his right on!
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Forget it.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
I take it back.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Why?
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Outside, in the cave.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Can you trust him?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
What have you done to my ship?
No.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Not really.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Thanks.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
... we're the bait.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
What is it?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Let's go.
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
He'll survive.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
But tell me why ...
Only what you take with you.
Never.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
That's the deal.
So what does this thing do?
Yeah, I got it.
The name's Plissken.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
We'll see.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Like hell I do.
The freeway.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
...I saw nothing.
So be it, to the death.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
Without Lancelot?!
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
Can it truly be used for magic?
You didn't ask!
I see, your excellency.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
What didn't he tell you?
Phonograph.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
Really? wow.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
Yes, I go now.
A stimulant.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Depression?
Never.
She used those words?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
That depends.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
What do you drink?
What's the difference?
Yeah.
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Here I'll show you.
Oh you wouldn't talk, well I didn't have my make up man there.
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
What?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Okay.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Damien Karras.
Karras.
How's the girl?
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Withering Heights.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Intensely.
It would bring us together.
In time.
Holy water.
Amen
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
She'll go into coma.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
From the psychiatric end.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Be silent!
Yes?
Do you have an appointment?
How old are you?
Is it Captain Howdy?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
They're falling out.
How many?
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
Two at a time?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How's the birthday girl?
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Count it.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
No, I mean it.
What do you mean?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Get out of here.
How about these?
Just a lucky guess.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
No, you take the right.
Because I can hear it.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
You could've come.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Just until we find another girl.
What?
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
This'll kill 'em.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
I can keep the beat.
Five years ago.  November.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
The flu.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
You find a girl?
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What-?
Save it for your wife.
Nine?
Sorry.  It only plays static.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Great.
Yeah.
They must've bought the same map we did.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Huh?
Huh?
Forget it.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Job.
Thanks.
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Baker.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Frank works hard.
I suppose.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Can't sleep?
Guess I got a little scattered.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Nothing.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
So ... ?
We outgrew each other.
I've given it up.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
I guess it's getting serious.
Wow.
Sure.
Eddie.
... Thanks.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
Is that what you think?
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
Go on.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Like you know anything about it.
You mean like ... condoms?
You can't blame me for trying.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Have fun at work.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? Theyre all panicked here...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways...
I think I could figure it out.
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
I never won anything in bowling.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Ive got all the time in the world...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
Its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here...
If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
What are you talking about?  Its me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Yeah...fine.
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
Youre kidding me...
Whatever you say...honey.
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
But you always seem so certain.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
And God love you for it.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
You wont regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/As...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Hey, are you okay?
Yes!
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Ben.  Are you okay?
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
I'm worried about you.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
And they're changing into...
I can go hotter!
Last one down springs for room service.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Front page?
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
I was talking about us.  Working together.
It's been changed.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Just <u>find</u> him.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
The Other Side got to him.
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
As part of the Crew.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
We're pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
You may learn to like it.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
You have no right to blame Duval --
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
Uh -- what?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
I could use a lawnmower...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...Would it kill you to say something?
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
We split that.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yeah, you already said that.
My wife! What the - how's -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Any others?
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
White Bear Lake?
What'd this guy look like anyways?
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
Yah?
Oh, man!
You bet.
Ya kiddin'!
What... What is it all about?
Yah, I see.
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Dad's here.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
Okay, real good, then.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
...Yah.
OOOoooh!  His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
I mean a parking lot.
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
It's my money, I'll deliver it - what do they care?
Mm.
Call 'em up.
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, Norm.
Oh, pretty good.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
It's okay, Mike...
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
So... they didn't...
There's the car! There's the car!
Your mallard?
Well -
There's no one else here.
We're still men.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Who do you think could've done this?
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
This could go on for hours.
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
I don't know ...
No, thanks.
Is this a trick?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
I'm sorry, I...
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
What?
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
What do you want me to do?
How's that working out for you?
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
All gone.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
Anyone?
Doesn't matter.
Good answer.
He was obviously able to handle it.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Uh... nah...
Don't mention me.
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Fucking sweet.
Tell him!
No.
What should I have told you?
Look...
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
... is over.
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
Um, well... technically, no.
I'm not going...
...to let this happen!
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
If you know, I know.
You want out?
Paraffin.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
... no, no, no...
But, this is Project Mayhem.
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
You're welcome to join our club.
I... I don't know...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
Take a guess.
Yeah?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Clean up?  I don't...
Hold on.
Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I wasn't worried about us.
Sure.
I guess so.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I know, we'll be there soon.
Thirty-nine.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Huh?
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Home on my strobe.
Damn!  Leeches.
Fermented fish sauce.
Powerful warrior.
Alright.  Home run.
Huntington Beach, California.
Nguyen is good boy.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
What's the plan?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
What that?
Mind if I sit down?
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
He's not a moron.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Where?  Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Venice...Like Katherine Hepburn in SUMMERTIME. . ....Why can't I be Katherine Hepburn...
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
They're --  -- What?
They said you're The One.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
I know...
Parry!
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
In a bar called Hellfire.
I'm still scared.
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
OWW...MAN...
You won't be alone for long.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
There isn't any more to tell.
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
I don't drink coffee...
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
I leave it to you.
Twinky?
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Shut up! All of you!
Is what you?
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Just finish eating.
I don't, huh?
No, let's go...
Fill it up.
Washington.
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Don't, then.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
He's had two strokes.
No...
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Tita, I've got to go...
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
Swimming?
Then after that?
Tomorrow, then.
Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
None.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
At being a fake.
I don't think that's accurate...
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
It is true.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
There's some good things on it, though.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Hi.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
You know somebody around here?
I did.
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
I got punished, man.
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
C'mon.
Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.
She lives near Eddie?
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
You said before, that he got boxes?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
You here to see somebody?
Positive.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
I'm a good friend of hers.
So, then whadda ya want?
Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
You mean her.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
That's what he said.
You're not taking real good care of yourself.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
It was planted on me, sir.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
I think Id rather have drugs.
Fletch...
My pleasure.
Affirmative.
You gonna nail the chief?
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
He'll be so relieved.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
What?
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Come on in.
Check.
Right.
Its okay. The cops did it.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Sure.
'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
Yeah.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
That's a strange combination.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
John Ultramalensky?
I was hoping you'd say that.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Gail, please.
In her cabana, sir.
She moved out.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
I never read the paper.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
My secretary.
Of course.
In a minute!
I ain't -- got -- you.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
No prob...
Exactly.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Yeah, let's bury her.
Who?
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How much?
Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Are you okay?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
No - no.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Yes --
Il est en retard.
What?
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Morning.  Sometime.
Policy man in Queens.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
I can't.
We put him to bed for the night.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
You're shitting me!
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
Did he?
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
Get him home safe.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Wait...
Huh?
Uh huh...
29-years ago.
I'm not dreaming.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
No wait, don't go!
What?
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Something happened, something...
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
No.
John, he's got my driver's license.
He took your wallet?
Huh?
Dad, you there?
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Longbranch...?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Same thing.
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
I don't know...
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Not now.  I'm cold.
I'll think of something.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I love you, man!
And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Did you stay here last night?
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
Sort of.
Stick around and you'll see.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
You're wrong.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
We're gonna scare him?!
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
I wish it was.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Whaddya mean?
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
What's it to ya?
But what I get scared again?
Which is?
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
That's it, we're done.
It's...It's all right.
Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.
Okay.
I know what it sounds like.
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About what?
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
Don't be ridiculous!
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
I packed it. Just for us.
Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
He is not.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Really?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
I gathered that.
I'd love to.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
But Rennie...
I'm not!!
Big mess every time.
It's over, finished and done with.
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
What do I exude?
You mean because What's-His-Name.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
It's just a review.
I think we Nought to wait.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
I hear Alan's sick.
What about her?
I talked to her two days ago.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
See, Daddy.
What else?
All right. What's been going on?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
Joanne Bourne.
I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
I don't know if I can say that.
Washed away.
Where the hell are you?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
You know the answer to that.
Oh yeah?
A grandmother. God bless you.
What am I doing?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Because faith is rewarded.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
Why do you care?
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
You're out of bullets.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
What color?
Yes.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
Is it true?
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Home.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I don't want you, Steven.
It is the work of untouchables.
Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
I've never spoken for anything else.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
Well, that's one victory.
God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
No?  What's keeping you?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Again?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
German.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
It's okay, Eugene.
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up".  What's wrong with her?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
Where are you going?
Antonio, the choir...
That's the hair color in his profile?
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why would we do that?
Where?
Does it have a name?
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
We could go together one day.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Hi.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
How's Estelle?
After four years and now the question comes up.
Yeah... I know.
My mind's not on guessing games.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
I see it...
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Do it my way.
You bastard...
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
I did I killed a man.
Whatever happens it's over.
You and me.
Where do we go from here?
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah.
I never have any luck.
Where?
Chicago.
You serious?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Who?
Yes. I told him.
What did he say?
Well, he drove it into the river.
What about?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Good evening.
That's nice.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Go on.
Was he?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Brumby.
Entertaining.
You sure about that?
Sure I'm sure.
Was it Albert?
Yeah.
Who set it up?  Eric?
Your brother? What you talking about?
No. It's all right.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Yeah.
Where's that?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Yeah.
I'm staying with a friend.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
No.
Think about it.
Do you want breakfast?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
They're friends of mine.
That's all right, Eric.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
But they have to be diplomatic.
What for? Protective purposes?
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
Ha.
That's right.
I...I don't know.
What?
I, I...I...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
The nurses?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
What?
How?
We're not actually talking about it.
As a robbery.
As a "robbery"?!  No.
Have I said that?
He'd give me a job.
What?  What?  The leads.
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Yes.
Do you need five grand?
It's a waste of time.
Everything I...you know...
I am?
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
To the cops?
A waste of time?  Why?
No.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Yes.
Did they catch...?
Excuse me...
Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
...no...
...then...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Either way.  You're out.
Then put me on the board.
I can't do it, Shel.
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
I'm not sure I have two.
That's alright.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
How do you know I made it up?
You're so full of shit.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying.  Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John.  On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
Guess who?
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
Fuck her...
"Always be closing..."
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
What is it?
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
Home...
I'm sorry...?
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Did I...?
Mmmm...
Gimlet.
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
What...?  Say the words.
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Eight units.  Mountain View.
And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They didn't get my contracts.
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
No, where is it?
Will you take me?
To do business.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
She couldn't decide.
What can we do?
Yes, thank you.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
I saw him with you.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Forget it, just go take care of her.
Mio fratello.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
It was hard to have him killed.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Why?
Am I a prisoner?
Sure, Mikey.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
But if you're wrong...
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
They are everywhere!
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Mike wants it.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
He's going to try Panama...
Tom, what do I do now?
No strings.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
Where?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
You would have killed his brother?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
You haven't heard me.
Where can we talk?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You said you were Klingman.
Not for a few years.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
You're a considerate young man.
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Of course you must keep control of your family.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
I do not.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
I thought we would meet alone.
Are we going to eat or what?
Don't I look like I'm listening?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
We got friends in the commission.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
What's to be jealous of?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I didn't mean to...
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Expect nothing fancy.
Why?
Well...no, not really --
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Huh?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Football in college.
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
It's new.
This David's a friend?
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I never thought you were.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
I was an officer.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
I want -- I want...
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
I don't remember that one.
Your friend?
What'd you say?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Need some help?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
Then take the pills.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
What's our pesky friend up to now?
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Go.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Right.
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
You want to come along quiet?
Let them go --
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Right ...
What's that?
Peugot convertible ...
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
And there she is --
We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
Of course ...
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
We'll take it.
Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Yeah ...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
"About what?"
What?
I can handle it --
Otto called -
"Shadow games?"
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
I don't know. What -- ?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
I left town. I didn't leave you.
Kip's in trouble
I understand -
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Unlock your button ...
Cut 'em...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Let me worry about The Club ...
What's that?
You remember Junie?
The hard part ...
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really -
Excuse me --
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
I'm in construction.
How much?
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
What?
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
Yeah.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
Yeah, yeah.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
So do I.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I don't want them left back.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Please?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Oh shit.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
You're fuckin' good.
No one. I didn't have the number.
She went to Medical school in California.
She's not stupid.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
It's an integer proof.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
I don't know what it's called.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Since Nancy died.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I live right around the corner.
Well, you're the only one.
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
What did you think?
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Nautilus?
Fine.
Why not?
So Christ, call her up.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
I didn't ask for this.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Don't fuck with me.
It's not your fault.
I know, I know...
Yeah, I think so.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Here's my number.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
No.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
Then let's go have some fun.
I've never seen your place.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
All right, all right. We'll go.
Want me to take a look?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
Come with me to California.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, I never. What?
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
They never wrote you nothing?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Get to what?
Yeah.
What you mean?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
California.
Sure. We aim to.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Sure. Good-by.
Good-by, Tommy.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
Are you crazy?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Won't they come out here?
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
We gonna take whatever they got.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
I wisht it was day.
Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
I never--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I'm a professional killer.
Okay.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Watched television?
Yes.
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Okay... Hold on...
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
That's probably a good idea.
You don't understand...
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
He using her.
I get it.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
And they want me to make up for it.
Jim?
He gave me a great deal.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Just who's been laughing at who here?
You sleeping all right in that house?
Need a lift?
Feel good?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I won't ask you to.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Fine!
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Why? There's no food in the house?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
You're right. Good.
Did you go riding?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
What are you talking about?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Who's there?
Exactly...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
I love you.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
She will if you think she should.
When are you coming home?
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
How are you feeling about work?
Yeah, what?
Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
She calls him Tommy...
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
Promise.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
What?
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Yeah.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
You know, you're a good kid.
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
I want to see Pilgrim.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
You just showing off for her!
We still have a way to go.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
Yeah, cool.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Yo, hit the lights.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Yeah? Display?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Thank you!
That's bullshit.
What's this one eat?
Fucked if I care, man.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Yeah.
Name your stakes.
You're not gonna win.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Okay. I'll copy it.
Okay, thank you.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
I know, I know who wrote it.
I'm trying to help you.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Let's echo 23, see what's up.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Congratulations.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
What number please?
Okay sure. What about?
Its about tonight.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
You don't owe me anything.
Michael Myers.
Who's that?
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady!
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
How many bodies did you find?
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
No.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Don't you mean what you do best?
I don't want to look pushy.
Its not over yet.
No problem, Sheriff.
If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Got it Ben.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
Dear God.
Evil.
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
Huh?
He shouts, too.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I can't.
No, he's not.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Go get me a beer.
Exactly what do you need?
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Where?
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Sure. Sure.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Was it the bogyman?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
I've given them his profile.
That's the idea. Here we are.
Are there any special instructions?
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Shouldn't we pick him up?
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Oh no.  Not at all.
I'm an architect.
What time do you get off?
Yes.
It does.
Well...
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
Hi.
...with the affiliates.
I don't know exactly.
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Well, sure.
Yeah.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
I have been in love with you for so long.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
I know it isn't.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
I know.
Mmm.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
I didn't say that.
No.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
It's on the table, Dad.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Hello?
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh...
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
He's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
I'd have been a great dope addict.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Yeah.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Oh?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
You got it.
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
How?
You're too demanding.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
No!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
We didn't hit it off.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
I'm okay.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
Hmm.
Really?
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
It's all right.
When'd you get here?
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
I <u>swear</u> to you...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Now, whyn't you help us?
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
What's new onna street?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Somewhere in Italy.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
You give me whatever I want...?
I won't take much of his time.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Try Barney Clark.
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
Waal...
A wonderful country...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
...and my need for The Institution...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Fine, thank you, but
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
I know where he is.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...I feel that...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
...yes...?
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
Because?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..

You're all making me blush...
Your Secret admirer?
That wants to be a Yes.
Nothing.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
Yes, it does.
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Don't worry, you...
It's not my style, okay?
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Oh yeah, that's it.
I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Yeah, maybe.
Is she dead?
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
Jealous much?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Like a suicide thing?
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Did not.
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.

Come on, sit up.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
Open this door!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!

Love, you can still write to each other.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
I know what to do about mother.
All right, then.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
I'm stumped.
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
I understand, I think. Other women?
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Yeah? You and who else?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Eighty four.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
This game is over do you hear me?
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
WHAT?!
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
I know a guy who only has one leg.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
Right.
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
You're sitting on your ticket.
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
What about a reward for coming forward?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
He's pretty... remarkable.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Well, it's for a woman.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
A man?  Was it a dream?
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
What's that?
I know it's at the high end of our range --
Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
What?
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
Look, I think we should work things out.
That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Shut up.
It's fun.
What about cable?
I have a cold.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Talk to me about what?
Congratulations.
Central Park.
And Brenda?
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
Leaving what?
I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
It's done.
What do you think?
I think you just like to eat dirt.
I lied.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
What do you want?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
New York is dangerous place.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
On the back it has--
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
We'll see.
I can take care of myself.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
I guess so.
You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
There is no way out.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
How about the cop?
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
Give up.
My father.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
We're trapped in a house.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
What hospital?
Yeah.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
How about dog shit?
I can't go without Thomas.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Yes, sir.
Are all of you named Jones?
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
They've been in there all day.
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I think so.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
How do I reach him?
What do you want?
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Excuse me?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
The front gate would be best, General.
Listen, you need me.
You have no whiskey?
What is it?
Of course.
Promoted. House Manager.
Of course.
What?
We must do something.
Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
We're running out of beer and other supplies.
In Ruhengeri?
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
A car.
I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Where?
Can I help you?
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
Not yet.
Oh dear.
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
I don't know!!
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Left, goddamnit!
The...Fourth of July.
Prove it how?
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
Run.
The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
I'm not laughing, Steven.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
I am.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
I'll take my chances.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
Rewind that.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Excuse me?
-- ten.
Sara...?
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Good-bye.
Yes.
You didn't think much about that before.
Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
Ok.
What about keeping an open mind?
A friend?
She's gone!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
What are you talking about?
I'm all right...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
I could see if I detect the presence of something.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Before.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Yes, they are.
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
Runic?
Not at all, if it can help.
I know what I saw.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
What happened to him?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
Right.  Right!
What is it?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Buying some drugs, alright?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
No.  Thank you.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
I miss you too.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Gum.
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Why try?
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Yeah.  The big E.
Could you believe that crazy elephant?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
This is too bad to be false.
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Yes.
Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Sharp.
The Hudswinger!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
I'm plenty happy!
Adenoids?
The couch, please.
I myself --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...I'm sorry.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Phony, huh?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
What the heck they doin'?
This you're familia' with.
I --
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz, you know I never --
But Buzz --
Yessir.
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Not even behind your back?
Get out of my sight.
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She sits down.
Maybe he's wise.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
...Her mother needs an operation...
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
That's nonsense, Alma.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
I'm afraid so.
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
But you didn't have to come up here.
Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
It's my day off.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
Yes.
What about her?
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
And as usual no one believed me...
What do you think?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
You go dry off now.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
We're not going anywhere.
Ben.
We'll talk in the morning.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Birth control.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Good night kiddo.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
It was lovely!
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Yeah. You?
It's not a bother.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
What do you mean?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Just be careful.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
The Idiot?
What is it?
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
No one.
Geometry?
Out.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
I'm chewing.
Wendy!
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
What time is it?
Okay.
That's all, for now.
Good.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Too bad...
Actually...
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Do it again.
That must have been awful for you.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
He would have liked that.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
Even the best make mistakes.
You know what about.
You know my plan of action.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
What are we thinking?
I'm always all business.
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
The other guy?
What was it?
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
There's nothing more to talk about.
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Nothing if not vampires...
Listen to me.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
Yes... My God...
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
Yes...
Never.
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
You really believe that?
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
I want it!
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Do you think so?
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
And they frighten you?
You followed me here, didn't you?
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
Yes.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
And did you lose her? Did she go?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
Yes...
Is that bad?
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Then, don't.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Okay, I won't.
Not me...no way...
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Come on, you can make it.
No, you're not.
Yeah.
Why are you being like this?
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
It's...him.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
Cool.
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
I'll go find him.
They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
They were gore before I came here.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
No one can take my father's place.
My last name is Pherides.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
I don't understand you.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
Listen to what I say --
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble  the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
I hate to do this, fella.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
Our clothes are dry.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
Where is she?
George Bailey.
That's the kid.
What's that book you've got there?
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
All right.
Today, over at the house.
Give the flower a drink.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
I'm all right.
Hmmm?
And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
And all's fair in love and war?
No.
No.
Yes  charge.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Oh . . .
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
How's that?
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
I don't like coconuts.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
In that place?
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
About what?
Do you like it?
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
That does it  come here.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Oh, George, George!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
What?
With butter, if they got any....
So's mine.
But of course.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Swim for it!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Good.  It's terrible.
Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
That's awful.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Not till next year.
It's okay.  What happened?
Did you get any pictures?
Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
The whale's mouth?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Okay, so that's it.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Home it is.
Nothing.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
Terrific.
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
We're alone.
We have to do something.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did he raise the Kids?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Great.
Who'd you ask?
3:30.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Anything.  Anything.
No.
Eat Cheerios.
Quiet!  Shhh!
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
No.
How many sharks have you killed?
Till this opens, not our wedding.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Honey, I gotta go.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Get out of here!
Just put your mask on.
Michael, the sub's dead.
Up.
I talked you into this?
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
Recovering nicely.
You don't.
What do you mean, we don't?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
I am.  You're not.
It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
Yes, aren't we all.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Some miss all their shots.
And big for his age.
Ten minutes ago.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
'Course they're also so rich.
You like Florida?
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
How come?
As always.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
The one that goes underwater?
He's diving!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Don't you dare.
It's disappeared.
Precisely.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
Polar bears.
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
You have a man near it?
Right, Mike.
All right, hit those lights too.
Sharks???
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Sure.
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
We need beer....
Tell Matt he should be here....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
He knows what he has to do....
That....
I'm hungry, Mom....
He heard that.
I'm just getting started....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
I am.
Promise me....
It was no accident....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No, you're not....
You'll be sorry.
I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
Why?
I'm sorry...I....
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
You tagging them...?
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
The readings suck....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
So did I....
Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....
Half don't...Bring her about....
Maybe it's gone....
What about Carla's gig?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
The van?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
You heard. Look for the knife.
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
It's a method for quitting smoking.
No, you didn't.
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
So am I. But where's my money?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
I was wrong.
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Now?
Hey ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
That's bullshit,
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
No.
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Yes.
Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
It was probably the wind.
Oh.
Really? What did he say?
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Why?
Why does he want to kill me?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
The man from the F.B.I.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
You find something curious in that?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
Ask him.
I know about the bachelor party.
One of the accountants.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Well, no you didn't --
I have to finish my job --
I think you added the "brutal."
-- stop --
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Happy for us.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
Same to you.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't know --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Good.
I might call you later!
Very much.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Pleasure.
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
You said "fuck".
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Shut up!!!
Quiet!
One way to find out.
What is it?
A bird cage.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Nothing.
He's this way.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
That one time was just the bumper.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Just hold on.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
They never got that big.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
What are you talking about?
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Not without a shot of the nest.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Where does it say that?
On the side of that one truck.
Okay.
To collect my fee.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
What's that?
Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Funded by whom?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
What?!
Where's Ian?
What one?
They are?  I'll be damned.
They died together?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
The what?
How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
Dilophosaurus.
Yeah, I know.
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
Alan!
They're not here.
I know, it's very exciting.
It's anti-nature.
Anti-nature.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Yes it is.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
You have no idea.
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Fine.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
There's gotta be something - -
For today, I guarantee it.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
Ray, start the tour program.
Thanks for the presents.
Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
Come on.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
_It's a second REM pattern_.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
What was the matter with it?
I read the one about the penal colony.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
An empty tomb?
You're detestable.
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
-- What could he have done to warrant that?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
What of it?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
I've heard of it happening.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
-- Listen to me --
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
-- You mean my Chief has it.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Jack!...  Jack!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
That's too bad.
Yeah.
Why?
Compassion.
Do you always have to repeat?
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
What was better? I made better bait?
Oh no, I don't think --
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
Mm.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Do you know where he got the dumper?
You said it was!
Well --
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Yeah, you got to me.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Mm.
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Right back at the start, right?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
Mm.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
About what?
I don't think so.
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
You must be discouraged.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
Just send me a money order.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Goodbye, Pete.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
Yes sir, we know he --
What does?
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--
I'm sorry.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Good night.
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Overruled.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
Yes.
No.
Was he unfaithful?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
How long was that?
You've been living here, in the city?
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Kramer...
Murray.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Fine.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
You're on your own, understand?
Slow down...Slow down...
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Ha!  You tell me.
But, I am in charge.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Thank you. Please sit.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Yes, but they say he did.
Do you have money?
Is that big?
No. This war is almost over.
It is an island. American territory.
And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Where is Poland?
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
You, kill me?
These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
What would you do, Holiness?
It is a difficult situation.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
What the hell are you doing?!!
A spring trap!
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Excuse me?
Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
It's okay.
Night.
Ssssh!
I'm not mushing it.
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Really--
Well...
Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You think?
They look like they're jumping.
So does he.
I just let go of it.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
Wait.
Else.
I want you to go there.
It has nothing to do with--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
I will... I promise.
I understand.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Jack Gordon.
Thanks.
I think we may be, yes.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
They weren't there. Get close-ups.
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Starling -
Sewing...
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Sometimes you do.
Yes.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Ahhh... Why?
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I - ran away...
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
Later, listen, I'll -
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Yes, miss.
Absolutely.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
What would you have me do?
Our father? Did you see my father?
What?
We were headed...
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
Webb's at Edward?
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Granted, Monsieur.
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
What?...
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Ahhhh!
Beautiful.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
I'm going to kill it!
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
I ought to smack your face!
I'm not touching you!
Your pocket?
Right.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
I am not fucking interested.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Is that you, Dean?
Furry muff, let's go.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Just give me the keys.
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
He means they're thieving dogs.
. . . What?
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
I like your bar.
I want your bar.
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
You know how much it is, Nick.
I'll only be a minute.
So?
Er, well, twelve.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Yes, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Sergeant?
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
So is Buddy on your short list?
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
That's not the point.
I'm not picking it up.
Same weight I always was.
Suppose not.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
So that's him--
Uncle Al--
The Trail of Tears.
So I'm part-Indian?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
You own this place?
Maybe.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
It's a .45.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Seriously.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
And people make their choice--
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
We was crossin' the river--
We have a daughter.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
That's a matter of interpretation--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
And the ten thousand?
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
And that was the last time you saw him?
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
You got in late last night.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
No--
Like your story is over.
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
The Republicans?
Yeah.
Just doing my job.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
No, Sheriff, I'm just--
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
He's gonna find out.
Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
D'Amour.
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
About?
I could scoop them out.
Harry.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
What then?
I'm here, aren't I?
It's okay.
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Sure.
Oh God.
Another fucking magician. Jesus.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
We've never met.
Maybe I just bought it.
Probably.
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
When will she be in?
Was that Swann's idea?
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
What about?
Does anybody?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
Yeah.  You could say that.
Not much.
The Puritan?
Who is he?
What?
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
For what?
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't know what else to do.
And you're not?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
I don't know.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
Call me tomorrow.
No.
Maybe... I... don't...
What about Philip Swann?
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
See you later.
Really?
No, you smiled.
Oh.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Well, I mean it more now.
Yes.
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Ok, well... I love you.
Good-night.
Uh, no.
It's just carpet.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
That's ok.
Why do you have to defend her?
What?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
I believe in you.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
We're still going to be together.
What time did you make it for?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
You have to tell me who did it.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You ready?
You raised me, like a son.
Just open the door, please.
Kelson, hold on a second...
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Peter, please...
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
I'm going to look around.
What?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Of course.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
Watch your mouth.
Child, take a bite.
Nothing.  So good luck.
I can manage.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
She's alright.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You want the job or not?
Yes, we appreciate that.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
I know...
I told him you looked like me.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
She hates all freshmen.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I don't know.  A lot.
Oh.
I don't.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
Good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fine, Quincy.
You're not stupid.
I...can't.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
What's up?
It happens, right...
Not really.
We're going to get some food.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Kiss my ass.
So...how's the knee?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
For what?
Your heart.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
With who?
Yeah.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
What?
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
ooohhhhhh no.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
I'm here, I'm listening.
It's a helluva disease.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
No one else in there with you?
No.
No.
Who was it?
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
About two years ago.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah.
That's great, thank you.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
No, no.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
That was so great what you just said.
You don't know how crazy I am.
It's ok.
just let me walk out, ok?
Have you ever been there?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
Just hold it, you'll be fine.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT, DAD WE NEED TO GET HIS MONEY AND GO.
DAD.
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
-- and I'm through playin' games.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Well --
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
What?
Shall we drink to that?
I'm sick.
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Your teeth are fine.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
He has Phil right now.
Get a girlfriend.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
It's ok.
No.
Graduation?
Twelve.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Yes.
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Go ahead and waste your time.
I'm quietly judging you.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
-- fuck you.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
She's retired.
Not a problem.
...this close...
It's not your given name, right?
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Kind of.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
I'm really sorry.
He's in here --?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Calm down.
No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
What does it look like?
I live alone.
No I Said.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
You on any medication?
Been drinkin' today?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
...you know...
Then what?
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
What happend to you?
Love you too..
It's not really pain.
No.  No.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Will that help?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
No.
I don't know....
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Maybe...I don't...
I really don't know.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
I can't.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
Water.
yeah.
Do you have that?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I don't know.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I hate it.
No, M'lady.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
I am preparing for a ball!
I wish to discuss your brother.
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Those can be adopted --
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Everyone back.
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Die?  What...?
I heard your playing.
Oh my friend.
Get out of my way.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
A personal nature?
... Two-thirty-seven.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
You set to go -
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
1490...Breckinridge...
How about Marvosa and the others?
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Did you have sex with her?
I don't recommend it.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
You look all right now.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Get me a plane!
I won't be here.
When I'm done.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
You wanna watch this or what?!
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
Have him peel the top label back.
Three minutes.
It'll do fine.
Tonic will be fine.
In the kitchen.
I'm fine.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I have work to do at the plant.
Me.
No!
I'm very scared.
I don't know...
No. I don't want to see you.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
No.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
No. I can help you.
Atlanta and Birmingham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Most people are.
I don't want to do that,
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
What would you call him?
We have it good, don't we?
Me, too. And very erotic...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
No.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Come home with me.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Go on to the house.
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
Yeah...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
I figured I'd ask you...
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
No.
And?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
What disadvantage?
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
No.
Do you dream much, Will?
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Yes.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
They're gonna lynch him!
Why isn't he MOVING??
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
That's the third white van I've seen.
It's Choi.
Right...
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
Sorry.
What are you doing?
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Are they any agent?
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Yes.  Now.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
That I would find the One.
Why?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
We need an exit.
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
Is it?
Are you worried?
No.
... right as rain.
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I don't know.  It just went dead.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
It wasn't fast enough.
Not yet.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
It's a city?
Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
The Oracle.
Neo, this has to be done!
Cypher, I thought --
Got it.
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
What the hell just happened?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Follow me.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Uh...can we give you a check?
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
What do you mean?
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Don't be smart.
No you're not...
Forget it.
What can I say?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
We'll settle it tonight.
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
Fine.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Yes, you did.
Oh...around...why?
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Nothing.
Wha?
It's all right.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Love that name.
Have you got a minute?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
But it's your birthday.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
A name?
We've got some things to discuss.
I don't like cake.
It's for the party, Dad --
I wasn't going to say --
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Drew, you're out of line.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Hot or cold.
Sounds good.
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Olympic.
What do you mean?
'Just kidding'?
For how long?  And why?
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
Well, that's very interesting.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
Make it go 'way.
Doctor lady make it irey.
What?
Yes?
I don't have any.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Then why are you here, Joe?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
I don't mind --
Be sorry for nothing.
Excuse me?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Gay?
For how long?
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
It's a saying.
Yes, that's why I said it.
Hold me --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
'Threw' you?  Where?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
It is a deal?
Yes, Bill.
So can I.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Are you sad, Bill?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Okay.
'Fish'?
Say again?
Which is what?
Those were my words, Bill.
Well, they're mine now.
Are you threatening me?
I am not a dream.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
And then --?
I think you know --
I'm here.
Time.
Watch it!
Yes, Bill.  The question.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Yeah, I give a shit.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
We're all ears.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Uh oh --
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
So what's wrong with that?
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
You're not listening --
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Raise away.
I don't know.
You and 'Honey'?
'Her'.
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
I would.
No --
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
What's it like?
What?
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Take the money and walk away!
Is that what your little note says?
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
What are you gonna do?
And? 
Yeah?
Kill him. I'll pay you.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
My name's Leonard.							 *
Then why are you here?
Thank you.
It's good.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Probably left it in your room.
Who's she?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Yes, I will.
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
You can't just take it!
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Sure.
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
How many?
Deal.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
No.
Why?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
'Cause she will tell you.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Port-Au-Prince.
Where?
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
As in...?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
You sure?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
They lied.
Lotta rich women back there...
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
What of?
Yeah.
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Get lost.
Is he all right!
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
You want to split your hernia again?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Would you recognize him again?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
It's not fair!
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
How long?
And?
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Section 13?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
I want to cut his throat.
You know where it is?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
Did you ask for bail?
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Yeah...?
Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
What-
Try not to sweat?
What is it?
I have no idea.  Are you ready?
No shit.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
How long...?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Misery?
I DIDN'T...
Perfect.
Yes.
I don't know.
Great.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
I said that?
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
To Misery.
Why would you lose me?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
"There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Newspapers?
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
And the check's in the mall.
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- this is very disconerting..
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Do what?
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
You didn't do that badly.
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Care to wait a decent interval?
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
That they're lying.
I'd like a little more conviction..
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
I don't.
And that's the only reason?
You don't trust me.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
No.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
You mean it'll be difficult.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
Why not?
Roger that.
Good job.  And thanks.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
You're sure about this?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Claire.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
Youre in Prague?
Yeah.
Who else is left?
Certainly Ethan.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Very good.
Bank?
My contact is extremely shy.
Give me a break, Pops.
Jim we cant.
Then what am I doing here?
A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
Youre probably right.
But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Loud and clear.
Why don't you take a look?
That's what we do isn't it?
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
No, I'm going.
The Shawfish?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
What?
You're welcome.
I'm going to bed now.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I don't know what you mean.
And that's how much I'm saying.
Bed.
Johnny Cammareri.
What are you doing here?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Let me come and talk to you.
That's it.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Why you talking to me?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I was dead.
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
That light.
What did you do?
I'm in love with you!
Alright. Where's the Met?
Thank you.
Awful?
This is where we're going!
I'm really afraid.
I was.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Alright.
How near is she to death?
Sure.
We should talk alone.
No.
Why not?
I don't wanna talk about it.
No. Are you drunk?
WHAT!! She was dying!
I know.
You're kidding?
That's incredible.
I don't know.
Of course I want to.
It was a miracle!
None of your business.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Then why are you eating alone?
You mean the whole house?
Marriage is happy news.
Does wood sink in water?
You're using coconuts!
So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
King of the WHO?
You don't vote for kings.
Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
You said it again!
What, "is"?
Then you shall die.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
I've had worse.
Had enough?
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
My liege,  I am honored.
Who ... Who breaks out?
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
You know my name?
Quite.
Man!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
I'm ... your son ...
No.  Until I come and get him.
... and you'll come and get him.
Yes?
No, not anyone else - just me.
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
I don't think I was.
Ector.
Please ... we are doctors.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
Kitchen and lower house.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
I see.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
I'm sorry?
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
There are important papers from --
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I'm fine.
I do what I do.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
She trusts you, John.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Aye, ma'am.
Yes.
Those, over there, there.
Are they worth reading?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Have I ever let you down before--?
Because I have to! 
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Yes.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
The same, your Majesty.
Why?
A few days, ma'am.
Of course, at once.
Why?
Again?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Your Majesty --
I have a letter, ma'am.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
What's the question mark?
You don't like it?
What the hell are you talking about?
It's twelve-thirty!
Laurie's.
Like the fractals?
No I'm not...
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
Right, then...
I don't want to talk about it.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
In this world, wrong is right!
Yes...but...how did you...
That's impossible.
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
I'm going home.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
You gotta be kidding?
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
Howdy to you.
Yeah.
Whatever.
That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
I was afraid of that.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Diane?
Mulholland Drive?
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
I'm not sure about this.
I'm all right.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
No... but...
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
No, we don't.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
I had a dream about this place.
The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Where's the dock ?
No !
Why should I ?
So what do we do ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
He hired you to build this place ?
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
Just shut the fuck up.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Not yet.
So ?
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
What do you mean sir ?
Sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
Then what do you want ?
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
What happened ?
How can this happen ?
Yes.
As appealing as that sounds...
Sure.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Are you writing a poem?
This is California, anything is possible.
Gee, that is a problem.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Hi Dad.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Totally groovy huh?
I will. How's Shelly?

More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
I know that.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Hi.
O.K. Thank you very much.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
What, you think the guy should change his name?
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Was Rose.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Committed.
Yes, it does.
Bye.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Phil for God sake.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
I mean...with your car.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
You have no idea.
Good for you baby.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Deceased.
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Goodnight Shelly.
Goodnight.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Did you ahh, love him?
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Any more soda left?
You never cared before.
She likes to play bingo.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
No sweetheart, you can't.
There were just too many of 'em.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
I'm very nervous.
Why?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
No, no no....
Hi, is Vada home?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
What do you get for that?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Why do you think she says that?
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
My Dad was funny?
That's really cool.
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
What are they about?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Goodnight.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Hurry!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
You have no personality.
Duck!
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Sure.
I wanna live with them too.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
No, I'm hiding out.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Neosporin?
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
He said that, too.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
And the answer was so simple.
... whatever is manly and independent.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He won't get mad, huh?
Don't you see...
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
I can't wait for you to meet her!
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
What, leaving school...
I never eat when I'm serene.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
It's more than that.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
If you find her...
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Then why are you listening to her -
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
What did you say your name was?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Okay. Thanks.
Well, it's probably because it would help him.
How is that?
Your job, huh.
What does he want?
That's what he wants.
Hal Phillip Walker.
It's the den mother.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
What is a turkey shoot.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
A little. What do you need?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
Who's that?
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
What year?
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Hi.
Wrong.
Car pool?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
Oh.
I'm twenty-eight
I know. Goodbye.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Money's no object.
An album.
You're not.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
I'm Opal.
You do?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
You think I got any kind of a voice?
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Sure thing.
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
She was born without a tongue.
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
We are.  Your camera.
NO!!!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
You made every day like kindergarten.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
They actually apologized.
Rockin'!
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
By all means.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Ya know, I was.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Two guys?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Where's Wilma?
Where's he at?
Okay.
Guess so.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Yeah, I been there.
Yeah. On the section gang.
In Birmingham.
That's right.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Go on - you can have one!
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Take it easy.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
What d'you mean?
That's the way he is.
How about it?
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
You didn't answer my question.
Don't look so scared.
Yeah.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
What d'you mean?
I bet she's easy jam.
Yeah. That's right.
Great.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Good-bye, Duff.
Guess it's never been easy.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Right here.
Since when?
Of course.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
It hasn't yet.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
Prepping your trip.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Less than thirty minutes.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
What?
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
On a good run... yeah.
A regular Fagan.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
It sounds like you.
Put the gun down, Case.
Shhh...
Give me five minutes.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
You're out of time, man.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Oh I know.
College?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Who told!
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Very romantic.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
By Guy?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
He's my teacher!
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
But I'm not a penguin.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
It was a long time ago -
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
That's the spirit!
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
You like her?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
So what are you thinking for college?
You have to say that. You're my student.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah, actually I do.
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
Yeah. Definitely.
Lock.
No!
For this.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
He stayed a long time.
Specifically.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Don't tell me it's not the gas!
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
He'll die with me!
Yeah.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
About what?
I'll get over it.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
Fine.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Wait and see.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
It's an amazing gift.
Sure.
What?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
A little basic, but nice.
With Hypnocyl?
Just until we get things under control.
So do I.
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Everybody take five.
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
How do we get in?
What are you talking about?
What?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Orange juice -- probably not.
Really, no.
Oh right.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Okay.
Okay.
That's fine.
Why?
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
With a goat playing a violin.
You have a stunt bottom?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
How do you think I'm doing?
I don't know what happened.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
Christ, what is going on in there?
Yes.
Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
Shame!
Well, yes.  Groovy.
It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
The others?
This is Henry James film?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
No, no.  She doesn't.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Right.  No one else?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Mister Sefelt?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
O-o-o-oh...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Go ahead! Go back!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah, Mack?
They went that way.
Yeah!
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
What?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
Me. Hit me!
A nickel.
I'm hungry.
He's not!
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
All right!
Ten bucks.
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Oh...
Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Why, sure, ma'am...
At this hour?
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
He's dead.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
What great aunt?
No...
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
Amazing.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
I'm in love with you.
Tell me.
Right now?
Well, good.  Good for you.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
I think he's having an affair.
It's still the new year...
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
What is it?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
Oh my God.  Where?
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Men have ways.
It was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
Who said I was going?
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
I thank you.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
That's really romantic.
Sorry...
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.
Why should he forget it?
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Thicker than water.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Don't say that!
Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
Hello, Edie.
Which side are you with?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
I only live up there and across the roof.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
His racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Terry, what's wrong?
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Terry...?
I don't get it!
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
I can? Okay.  Okay...
Nice fellows.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
No.
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
First things first.
I'll see you on the roof.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
By way of Chicago?
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
I'm not sure...
I'm afraid I'll faint.
You do?
What can we do against them?
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
It would seem so, Master.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
The moon is almost gone!
For what!?!
You better hope there is.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
What do you suppose for?
Aannnnaahhnn.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
What're you talking about?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
I'm a tourist.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
And then they'll kill 'em.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Sure, Daniel.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
I thought everything.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
If I could have a little more room.
In my bag, in the car.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
Yeah...
Really.  He has a cop's face.
Think I could have them back?
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
Love it.
You did?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
That's not what you were about to say.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Where?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
You know.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
When?
Any time.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
Meaning?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
It's a guy you know.
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
Can I do what?
I <i>was</i>...
What do you want?
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
It's a --
He's still married though, huh?
Oh, he's moved out?
I really gotta go.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I didn't have time.
So?
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Out for the evening?
Like a fag.
Likewise.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Foley's got it.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
How would I know.
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Land of the free...
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
I was grieving too.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Home of the Brave.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Well...sure.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Well sure, Colonel --
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
Fook ya dooble!
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I'd take better care of my teeth.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
That loudmouthed little bitch~
Aren't we a little old for that?
That's disgusting!
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
I'm not going.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Why wait?
Good.
Great, isn't it?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
I have to talk to you..
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Charlie? Was I dead?
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Touchy, touchy!
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
Is that one of your poems?
I'd love to.
I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
What?
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
He'll win.
Oh no!
I'm home now.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Sort of.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
But accidents can happen.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
I... um...
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Yes... why?
You sure did...
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You never get over it.
You think he'd believe it if he did?
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
You're going to the office?!
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
Maybe you should think about it.
Whatever.
We're waiting...
Little baby girl.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Makeup.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Thank you.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
You're ready, don't worry.
I'm an excellent lawyer.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
What can I do?
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Gay movies.
Yes.
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Thank you.
I'm fine.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Who?
Since when?
Probably since she was born.
Fine, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
My lettuce is wilting.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
Lookit. Lookit!
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
'Mean the whispers?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
What, you're afraid?
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Not sure. Ten?
Only around humans.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Shut up.
Like what?
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
How many?
So what happened? Where are they, then?
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
You know who Muhammad was?
Some prophet guy?
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
For now.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Just realized that, huh?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Nice embellishment.
What do you care?
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Neither do I.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
No.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
He's trying to form words.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Okay.
I want her.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
My name is Taylor.
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
Shhhh!
Second from the left.
Yes.
Like you, I find it difficult.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
I got one...
Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.  See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir... 
Dawn...
That's a nice way of putting it.
What you got there - beers?
Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
You know what I'm talking about!
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't know.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Okay. You win.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
No, please.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
I didn't say anything.
Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
Nice of him.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
You didn't have to tell him that.
Bad enough.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Couldn't be.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Nothing matters.
So have I.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
If you're doing all this just for me.
That's right.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
You-killed-him?
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
Would I want to?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
If I understand what you meant by that.
I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
You mentioned information.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
A private joke.
You're not English.
How's life treating you?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
You can find out.
So?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
Yes, sir.
But you still think she's innocent.
Two.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
You already have the checks, darling.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
I think you'll do very well.
Yes.
Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Good.
Thank you.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
You just might.
Might?
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Not yet you know any of these people?
The Argies.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Far too long.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Why not sit down and wait?
Suez.  1956.
Take a look at these.
Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
That's good.
Yes, you said.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
No.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
What's their program?
A flaw I'm working on.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
You never were...
No.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
That's the point, isn't it?
The shit they pull, huh?
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
I'm serious.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
Hawkins?
Where the hell is his body?
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
You're not getting any navy contracts.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Hope to be?
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
How?
Fine.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
What?  Why?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
The Rex.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Why not?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
The opera.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
What happened to him?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
I'm here.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Vivian's in sales.
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I pray for that.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Kit give me nothin'.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Okay.
You're a guest here?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Excuse me?
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then I'm here till I die?
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
You mock my pain!
But how can you be sure?
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
What do I do?
True!
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Yeah?
How many could you handle?
The body?
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
I hope we win...
Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Yes.
Okay.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Yes.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Not yet.
Stop saying that!
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Hah?
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
You are ready, then?
I am not left-handed either.
Get used to disappointment.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
Then make your choice.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
"Honeymoon,
Oooooooops!
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
What did I do?
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
How's this? 
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Then stick with Bialystock!
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Only if we ask him.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
No.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
Very early. Dawn.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
And when she left, she never came back.
She isn't still here, is she?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Money.
What are you talking about?  What is this?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
I don't need pills... just sleep.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Here?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I ought to call the police right now!
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
You want me to stay here?
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Sam, I'm going.
Where could he have gone?
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I have to go, Sam.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I haven't even been married once yet!
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
The bathroom.
You'd know, of course.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
You're not going to... to your room already?
No need to apologize...
At this hour?
Have you two had breakfast?
Better sign in first, hasn't we?
Haven't any.
Satisfied with your cabin?
And now that your mother's dead?
I don't know what you've been saying.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Why didn't you notify the police?
But where do the rats come in?
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
I'd like to have a look.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
How? What can I do?
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
That's the way I feel about it.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
I'd love to.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
It happens that I'm the law.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
And they never proved anything against him.
Get out of here.
Now don't that call for an extra!
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
No kiddin'.
Thanks.
My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Oh, is that what caused it?
Heaven knows. A lot.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Fire insurance!
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
Yes....
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
What did you expect?
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
But I'm curious, Rose.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Yeah.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Well, yeah.
I don't know.
Well... maybe...
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Here comes Daddy.
How could that be, son?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Yes, we know her.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Oh. Did you say something?
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
The hell we can't.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
What did you forget?
Over... my... dead... body!
Fine.
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Well, it has buttons.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Oh, no, sir.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Oh, yeah?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Well, you run on now.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I was going to tell him.
But... I love him.  I do...
You're not gonna see him again.
Incestuous.
You think it's that good?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Abe Lincoln...
Again.
What'd I say?
That wasn't my fault.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Yeah.
Wha... ?
We have to find Kittle.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
No.
Nope.
There probably is.
Bummer.
Maybe.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
Well, sir...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
You think this is so easy?
Dead.
Maybe it's enough.
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
We got separated.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Tell me.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
I will not fight you.
Never-r-r!
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Yes or no will do.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Uh huh.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...I'm sorry.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Sharp -- Real nice.
...What?
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
Paulie!
It's not your house --
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Only a pig would say that!
Give my main man a raise!!
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
No, man, it's very smart.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
This a con?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Ya, somethin' like that.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ain't they?
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
...What?
...Shrewd.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Real good.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
Creed's great.
Ya always in a bad mood --
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Ice skate.
Gazzo's a good man.
Whatta you think?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Do you feel you have a chance?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
So where is it then?
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Take it easy.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
A Toon?  Noooo.
No, it's not.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
By my head here come the Capulets.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
He shall be endured
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Goodnight.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
By the hour of nine.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
That dreamers often lie.
I thought all for the best.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
I don't know.
How do we know that?
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I still am.
I didn't say I was.
Bloody fucking hell...
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Next.
Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
There's been a slight problem.
I take it you still want the money...
Enough!
I sent it to myself in Paris.
So what do we do?
What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
Then I guess we're set.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Call it a reckoning of character.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Did he bring that with him?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I can do that.
That's what I thought.
As in, they own it?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
So is the woman.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
I'm going with you.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Business keeps you on the road?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Would you stop with that...
You sure?
I'm sure.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
I'm alright.  And you?
It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Seven thousand...
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
At the expense of six people.
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
And how do you figure we do that?
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Well what are we supposed to do?
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Rock solid.
My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
I'm all ears.
Hello.
Nothing happened?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
I don't believe it.
What did he buy?
I have a better plan.
What?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
We are having a sale on some items over here --
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
About what?
Forget it.
What?
So I want the money and I want it now.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
So...what's the good news?
So someone did get away.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Two-hundred thousand!
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Is this about the funny money?
This is your ship?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
That's right.
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
This is a very dangerous man.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
I'm okay, you go.
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
What did you say?
Gimme the binoculars.
Get it out of here!
It's a bomb.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Fine with me.
See you in the next world.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
Yes.
Some Kung-Pao?
Fine with me.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
I'm fine.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Ricky Tan?
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Carter.
It's the same thing!
Witnesses.
Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stooly.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Excuse me?
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
No...what?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
That's what you were supposed to be!
What?!
Or somethin'.
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Ambassador Han.
Yes.
I do.
I'm not running.
It's hurting.
His hair... any color.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Then come for dinner.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Oh, please!
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Yes.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Six-fifty.
Done.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
You know, there's no...
That was very interesting research George was doing!
This is getting serious.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
She's the boss.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Quick.  Very quick.
No.
Yeah.
Nope.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Go to the Symphony --
I don't think so.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I should say something in this about magic.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Mom!
It's me?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
I don't know --
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll like it.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Yeah.  What's that?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
What is it?
I don't think I have to now.
No, I'm not, but --
Sure.  Looking good.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Go to sleep.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Good.
Jonah!
There's a bathroom upstairs.
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
This is the one I like.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
I say we gotta take action. Now.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
What are you saying?
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
You've got to help around the house!
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
That's it?
You mind?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
What happened to your eye?
Trust me. We're safe.
This has nothing to do with him.
What is wrong with you?
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I don't want to.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
Midnight?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Don't get carried away.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Can your man handle that?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Can you set that up?
Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Thanks for not laughing at me.
You aren't coming with me.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
And you want me to do you some big favor?
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
What?!
Just some buddies.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
This chink have a name?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Answer the fucking question!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
That would be me.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Maybe he isn't showing.
A private, sir?
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
As a matter of fact, I am.
In West Fork?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Shut up, will you?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
Wade?
Gives Wade the second shot.
It seemed appropriate.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
You don't count.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Yep, hell of a mission.
Nope.
Let's just find someplace.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And what about your own hand?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
What are we going to do?
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
But, sir...
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
There's always a bright side.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
I don't like that one.
Have it your way, Captain.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
We know.
Speak with my lawyer.
And your former wife.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
I still am.
But you never had a first date.
Please?
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I already did.
Read it.
Meaning?
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I can accept that.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I'm fine.
You're going.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, I love him.
What am I supposed to think?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
No, I'm serious.
Then call me later.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
Well... just meet her.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.
Right.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
You're shaking.
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah.
It sounded like you did.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
What do you want?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
Hello Lloyd.
Are you?
Just her name.
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
What?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
Alright.  Key?
How you doin', brother?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was just going to kind of move around.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Now you're back.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
They're not gone, they're here.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
Yeah, what's that?
True.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
So I'm responsible for the weather?
This is not my problem.
That's great, thanks.
God bless you, sir.
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
Yes.
There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
They arrived, can you believe it?
You did so much.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
No.
That doesn't work, sir.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
That's smart.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Where is everybody?
I'm inquisitive.
I don't think that's a good idea.
You could start with an apology.
I did that.
Its over, Cotton.
Not until youre dead.
And much richer as a result.
Why don't you ask them?
Youre all in this together?
But youll never get away with it.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
So we found a compromise.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Stay away from the cop.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
My morn was a Delta.
I dont know.
The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
What's your favorite scary movie?
But...
Now.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
I don't know.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
Thanks.
More of a game really.
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
What?!
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Reaction to what?
I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
What do you mean?
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
What?
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Need to get in that building?
They're the ones who approved it.
Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
You're not happy with your part.
Huh, fine.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I thought you wanted me here?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Who the fuck is this?
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
She looked dead. Still does.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Now that it's out of your system.
No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
It's been a year since she died.
Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I don't know.
It happens. Take it easy.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Just some scary movie.
You have to have a favorite.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
I told you not to hang up on me.
So you better leave.
Then he dies. Right now.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
No...
I can't think.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
He's not a suspect, is he?
You never know when or where a story will break.
Then what are you doing here?
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
Sidney's father?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Casey? Casey?
Call the police.
The phone's dead.
You want to go live?
What's the delay?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
The official term is "psychotic".
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
I'm in.
Announcing what?
One is gluttony.
Good.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
It's always been like this.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Hello.
It's not too far away now.
Spit it out.
Murderers like you?
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
For now.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Good.
Nothing.
I know.
Okay.  But, what?
Just wait!
No.
I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Yes we do.  Here...
You got to be kidding.
How do you know all about this?
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
Okay... okay... get off.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
I will.
I... I don't understand.
Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Yes, sir...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
You've done a lot of growin'...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
But I just bought a good blanket.
Never heard of him...
Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Not likely.
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Only if I'm dead!
We got two around that age...
Where?
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
What?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
What?
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Oh
Never!
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Of course not!
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
It is all locked safe in here
God be praised!  Locked?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Who wrote that?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
To my weekly confession.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Tomorrow
What? Who?
The one who came with your letter?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
What do we do now?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
"Ay me."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
You lie.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
But why me?
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
It is only ours you can know.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
A theatre poet?
In the same fashion as chess.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
I'm only asking what you think.
Can I show you something?
Think about it.
So who's going to do it?
No, not that.
I can't do it.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Is that going to be deep enough?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
I don't know.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
Well?
I don't know.
Don't know what?
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
That's all?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Really?
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
-- which is a hack.
The man we know and love.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
All right. No problem.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
Who?
He can't stay up there.
We could put it somewhere.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
Don't you ever stop?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
What?
I should hope so.
You and me?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
But they sneer, don't they?
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
You know about it?
And that's not the same thing?
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
Look again if you like.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Or a fake?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
You mean that girl, don't you?
I know.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
What're you doing later?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
Why don't you see Lester?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Right now, I just don't care.
... what?...
I guess so.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
Hello.
No.
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Yeah.
I went to school with her husband.
Great... so how's everything with you?
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
No, thanks.
Whew.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Did Lester know about him?
-- what guy?
What about it?
I don't know what gets into me.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You were great.
He never stopped.
-- sure.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Look about last night --
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
I can't just let him stand by the door...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
What for?
-- why did you come in today?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
What?
No shit?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
What about me?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
How did it go at the bank?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Egypt!
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
George.
About what?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
When I get off work.
A friend dropped me off.
Look at the way I live.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
Oh, Christ.
I'd like you to leave now.
Did you?
What did you say?
Well, yeah.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Oh yeah.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
Okay.
Sit down.
Why, why do you think that is?
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.


Okay, okay...
Yeah.
Yes.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
No.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
See you later.
Well, you know what I mean.
I'm exaggerating.
He does?
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- uhh-huhh...
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- never mind.
Well... sure...
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
No, it's not that...
Do you have children?
Do you have something against traveling?
Have they sat down?
Everybody but us.
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
French Fries and Ketchup.
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny!
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
No.
Why not?
Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
It's okay, really.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Pleased to meet you.
What line of work are you in now?
That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them. 
Yes.
How do you like it?
I can't really remember.
Stay away from me.
Jack, stay away from me!
I'm gonna go now.
Well, my predecessor in this job
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Fine.
Jack is a schoolteacher.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Went shopping. Why?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
For getting a divorce?
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
What if it's some kind of monster?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I saw what I saw.
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
What you do?
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Vince...
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
This prom is a real drag.
Right.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
I knew that.
Again!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
I... I brought you something.
A novice.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Now you.
Really?
Honey.
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
What?
And all those like you.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
A what?
My what?
And whom would you call?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Mary Clarence!
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
No.  No.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
A vote?
What?
But -- why?
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
But...
You saved my life.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
Okay -- no limo.
No nothing.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
No -- worried about you.  Personally.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
They open a window.
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
We didn't tell you what?
I'm telling you!
It didn't happen.
You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
That should have tipped us.
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
But where?
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
I lied.
How did you hear this?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Well... so much for common sense.
I know it.
I'm sure I don't know.
Should we go back?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
What books?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Other people?
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Are you so superstitious?
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
It was not butchery.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Come with me.
What did he say, Katrina?
He moves too fast.
Use caution.
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
No.  She has gone out.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
Turn around.  Now!
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
What do you like to eat here?
Yeah.
Give me the big'uns.
What you got in there, warshing?
About a half a mile I think it is.
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Don't tell me what to do.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
They still around, your folks?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
Yeah, I recollect it.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
It was still alive when you buried it?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
You will? For sure?
We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Did Vaughan go home?
Did Karl go to bed?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I reckon.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Tolerable, I reckon.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Not really to speak of.
Did you knock on the door yet?
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
No thank you.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
What happened?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Yeah, I did.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Not a peep.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Every word.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You don't give up, do you?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Yeah, like what?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
Bully for you.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
What is this, some kind of joke?
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
And these?
The refrigerator?
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
What does that mean?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
You mean Rashid?
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Hi there, little brother.
Thomas.
Yeah? And why is that?
I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
In Manhattan?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
Thanks, but I'll manage.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
Are you going to be all right?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
You don't really want to know.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Yeah, it might be.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
It wasn't my fault.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
You done your math right.
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Closer to eight.
You're implying th...
I did.  But the jury won't s...
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Twelve.
Oh, yes.
I have told the truth.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
No, you don't.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
Well, why does it?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
Sure, anything's poss...
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
Fresh!
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Tore off one of my chests.
Polish?
How can we?  We're broke.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
And where's he going to be?
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Have I got things to tell you!
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Security.
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
Like right after the ceremony.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Get me Room 414.
I may throw up.
Tell him you're going to elope with him.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Honey - she called me honey.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Interesting.
Anything wrong?
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
When?
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Come on, Daphne.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
No!
What for?
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Thirty-four.
Oh - here and there - and around.
I thought you said three years.
I am Cinderella the Second.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
About that roadhouse -
Yes, Osgood?
Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
You ain't going nowhere.
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
And you'll be in all evening?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
I'll say.
You can't trust those guys.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
What's in Florida?
Your view of what?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
That's very interesting.
For your own amusement?
Shell Oil?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
For me?  It's Shell Oil.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
It's all right for a bachelor.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
That makes me feel just awful.
Talk about sad.
Thanks just the same.
From a rich millionaire.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
You're not?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Go where?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Why?
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Im fine. I promise.
Hey.
Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Or Kat....
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
You are taking the piss?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
What?
Maybe not her least... Theres always--
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.
What does your gut say?
Why?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
I have a friend at the magazine.
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
What do you think?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
What?! No, no. You cant--
Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
Hi, kiddo.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
I try...
Colored.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
You could? How?
Yes mam...
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
You learnin' anything at that school?
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Act like one!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Yes, mam...
Did you find your father?
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Yes, ma'm...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
I'll walk...
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Tired.
Is there something I can do to help you?
Pillow.
I saw him last night!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
You bet your fucking ass it was!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
Mph rm rmph!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric?
A hunger strike? For what?
It's... It's not good children.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
MOM!!!
Yeah, I guess.
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
What the hell is going on?!
Oh.
You bet, Terrance!
Canada is saving us!!
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
No! It can't be!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
You didn't?
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Anna...
Anna...
You're Warren Wayne.
I did nothing to the monitors.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
The device has stopped responding.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
10-4 good buddy.
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Just don't move around too much.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Well maybe we can do something like that.
Just considering our options... sir.
Great.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
We have room!  Let's go!
And so far.
Marry you?
Try not to think about it.
No, just enjoying the view.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Right, I understand that...
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
No. I'm from Akron.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
Sure, Sid.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Wait! That's an aria!
I'd buy it!
Seven years.
Wish me luck.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Thanks.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
Don't say that about my mom!
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
SHEILA!
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
No!
It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
How Mr. Kastle?
Like this?
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
Zip.
It's Junior, isn't it.
Did you - kill him?
Are you sure he's dead?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You're really pissing me off.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Open it, Captain!
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Wait a minute --
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
How about I just press the button?
How long will that be?
Two and a half days?
But she's --
What if it attacks?
The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
What team?
Press?  No, I haven't.
From what?  What's with all the security?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
Hold on --
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
Everything can be killed.
No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Pull it.
In the ship, sir.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
What sub?
My gosh, Norman.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Yeah, why?
What are they?
So what?
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Four days?
I would.  But my suit --
I fixed your suit.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
He what?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
We must've had it delivered then.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
Manifested?
What?
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Something for burns.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Tarazine?
I'll just boost the doses.
Doesn't say.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
No, he isn't.
You think I manifested the snakes?
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Is it?
Beth --
How's that?
You're staring at me.
Is it coming from our own computer?
I'm not being defensive.
I don't follow you.
What noise?
You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
You don't understand about the sphere.
What are they?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
That's right.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
That's right.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Think about it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
I don't see anything.
Please, Ted.
This is like nursery school.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I'm beginning not to like you.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
What do you mean?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
What do I do?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
No need, everything's under control.
They'll find its weakness.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I read you sir.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
You got it bad.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Zander, please... Let's go !
So ?
A funeral.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Is it true ?
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
I don't want everyone to see.
It's all I think about anymore.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
I'm on it !
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Don't stand there dumb... GO !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Uh, no.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Yeah, that's right.
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Yes, sir.
Give'em hell, sir !
<U>Answer</U>!
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Granted.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
A tractor beam...
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
Ten seconds....
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Sit down, please.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Tractor beam remains constant...
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Annie...got an umbrella...?
We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
Who?
The people in New Hampshire.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
Why did you quit?
Why?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
<u>Yes</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Yes.
That's for sure.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
You got a paperclip?
I do if you do.
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
No, that's true.
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Yes...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
I saw...
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Yes, that's right.
Ten thousand dollars.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Who is this person that you've found?
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
This horse is booked.
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
But we...
Look, look there's someone else...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Who are these from?
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
...yes...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
What is the...?
Gut Yuntif.
How about that.
He saw the accident...?
Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
I can't find the writer.
Not now.
I...?
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
I'm out.
For what cause?
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
I can write it.  I can't type it.
I don't...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
He's got a gift for fiction.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
...the city council...
Yes, I hear it.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Mommy's marrying Rache!
Mass hysteria.
...why do you think?
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
I'm not.
Hold lunch!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Not use my words, please!
Alright starve.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Where are you, anyway?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Is your bad?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Before you.
Rache can do that part.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
Have you still never told him?
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
Me too.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Good...Well...Take care.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Don't do this.
And I'm supposed to care.
We...
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
And we all went through that together?
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
I was in there in him.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Look, I...
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I need practice.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
You mean, after I'm dead?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Don't be too sure.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
No, there isn't.
You're the hip and fresh.
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
Not yet.
I think so...What do you think?
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Does Jackie know this?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
You know...Stanley...
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Great to be here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
I'm always working.
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Speak English.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
You have a bay?
My grandchild-baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
Huh?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
...gger.
Nigger.
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. But not any more.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
You should be.
You know...I like you.
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
So where'd you get in?
Prnceton.
Thanks man.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What are you talking about?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Like where--in your dreams?
I don't want any...
I insist...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
How much do they have?
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
What does that mean?
Moffo!
Did you get that, Kulnick?
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
That's right, fella.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
General Schmuck?
I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Yes, sir.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Plan-R????
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
That's right, Major.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
And if that were true?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I see.
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Admiral Buldike?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
I don't think so.
War?
Check.
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Yeah?
Primary arming switch.
Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Master Kong.
Everything still checks out okay.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
What do you mean?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
What are you talking about?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
Roger.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I thought maybe you'd like some company.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Mm-hm.
Was it okay?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Oh.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Yeah.
No.
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
Uh, last night...
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
You know?
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Y- s-sure it did.
Erica is in the van back there.
Buff...
She's dead.
Yeah, man.
No.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Good. See you later.
No, but I heard it was great.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
A reel?
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Maybe upper-middle-class.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Taking care of business.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Funny shit, man.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Mm-mm.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Oh, shit.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Is that Bee-Bee?
Seven-twenty.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
That's right.
It's a piece.
One!
I'm talking about idealism.
Okay, what would you have done.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Mm.
Jeff!
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I, yeah.
No, it's not...
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Yeah, really.
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Get off my property!
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
No, this has everything to do with you.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Yeah.
You do?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Cleo!
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Positive.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
She thinks you went to the police.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Let me explain something...
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Your help.
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Roll 'em.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
How about the Rainbow Room?
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
With a wildly beating heart.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
You're tough, all right.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
It must be my new shampoo.
No.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
I knew there was something wrong with them.
You're a writer, you said.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
I need some money right now.
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
You're a darling.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Yes, Norma.
Good.
Good.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Good.
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Haven't got a thing.
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Yes.  Madame.
Yes, Madame.
You know better than to interrupt me.
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
No, a super girl.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Let me kiss you.
Well...I guess one is all right.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I sort of like what you said.
Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
I'll drink to that.
I don't want your help.
Supergirl?
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Oh, no thanks.
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
I can't help it if men notice me.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
You're not...an orphan are you?
Thank you. You're very kind.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I'd love to.
Sure. Mate in five moves.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Cheap but effective.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
But it's impossible.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar!
Tuesday.
Brad?
Clark.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Old ties are hard to cut.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
What's that?
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say who?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
You just did, with that great dinner.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Gus?
Hello.
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
We can get to work on that oil!
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Actually, yes.
Maybe I could try --
Really?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Lois, someday --
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
A parka.
It's beautiful.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Sensible enough.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
He ran in fear from us . . .
It will. Starting with your own.
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Any more like you back home, Clark?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
You're just an experiment, freako!
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
You are . . .
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Thank you.
We're running out of smoke.
Albert!
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Some people aren't the athletic type.
Come again?
Super...man. Hmmm...
So I've noticed.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
La de da da...
What do you suggest, my dear?
The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
Two.
What's your name, boy?
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
He'll be weightless.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Twenty-four.
There are none of them any good anyway.
He is. Usually.
You've got me? Who's got you???
Do as I say. Let go!
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
I came to talk to you.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
Oh.
It must feel great.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Do bullets really bounce off you?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
I'll tell her that.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Case?
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Was it good?
Yeah.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
The children.
Why not?
Because it's what we have to do.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
It's natural.
Good night.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why?
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
And what's that?
What do you mean?
Did his parents attend to that?
What's that, Dolores?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
Why would he be frightened?
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Yes.  It's a present.
Who's Mr. Stephens?
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Yes.
I won't lie.
That's the local bar?
No.
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Yes.
Yes.
I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
Please.
Yes.
What time in the morning was this?
And where did you sit that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
Why were you scared?
Pretty slick, eh?
It's okay.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
As opposed to this T.V.?
But Charlene...
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
I see you're full of human feelings...
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Did Sidney tell you about it?
I said Sidney!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
Now don't kid a kidder.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I don't?
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
- He's got them on him.
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
He wants me to break a leg?
I hate to see you like this --
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
You tell him, I stutter!
I didn't do anything!
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Why did you call me?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Where you going?!
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Unknown.
Correct.
I have detailed files.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
I guess so, sir.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yes.
And your father was executed.
What's not right?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Your guess is as good as mine.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
And what was that?
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
And what did he say?
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
How could I know what's in the archive?
Helmuth.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
One of your people told me.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
His private life?
Yes, Dr. Furtwngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
When you got to the crescendo.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwngler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Come to the office, please.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
I hate the beige one.

We will, kiddo.
What's it to ya?
What's it to ya?
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
What?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
That's the way it was told to me.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Don't say that.
No.  I'm not.
No.  Never.
You're not supposed to.
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Please, don't do that...
Oh, no... you.
I don't know... he fell.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
Please...
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
That one did.
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
What's wrong?
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
What?
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
... what... ?
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I have to show you...
I didn't know what else to call you.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Originally, Connecticut.
Studied acting, I assume?
Underwear?
Always.
Never better.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Call them.  Trust me.
You dodged a bullet.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Yeah.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
Not much, I think.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Why are you following me?
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Nothing else?
Attempted murder.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Yeah.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Luke.
You could have.
You want company?
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
I don't know.
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
Test it.
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Mrs. Dudley.
So far.
What did it cost?
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
No, it's getting worse.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
It's not a knock.
Anything but Japanese.
Because --
Our black friends?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Round about, yeah.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Same.
Really.
Hard to miss.
Been busy, have you.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
How'd you manage that, then.
He give me your address.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
-- Your employer?
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Have you ever known me not to be.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Depends, don' it.
I'll bloody well ask him.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Just now?  Overnight?
He alive to see this?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
So what's your beef, pal?
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
He had urgent business in the north.
You sure?
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Where else?
Yeah.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
You do?
Is he here?
You know I don't live with him.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
But more or less.
...Uh-huh.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Sure.
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
All right.
All right, I guess.
What is it, Dave?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
But it's...
Please, Ed.
You sure you don't want something stiffer?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Who?
How are you?
...OK.
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
OK.
...Nah.
Yeah.
They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
We're just closing, friend.
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Uh... you're under arrest.
Anything missin'?
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Where's the walk-in safe?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
I believed them.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Look who's here, Margo.
Yes.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Big as a house.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Holy mother, what is that?
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Quiet.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
Behind me.  Over there.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
For what?
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Sweep the harbor.
<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
You're the star.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
Now.
Yeah, what happened?
I can't tonight.
--Truman, what are you doing here?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
I've got to show you something.
What's that?
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
Oh, God.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Should I?
You're the one talking to the walls!
Things always do--when you look back.
Were you there--how do you know?
Well, we're FBI agents.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Penetration but not perforation.
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
No, they don't.
They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
You got some kind of business with him?
Looking for him for what?
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Your guess?
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
No you didn't.
All I told them was the truth.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
I can't really talk right now.
What kind of infection?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What did you find?
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
It may be extraterrestrial.
I don't know.
Just like that --
I think... something stung me.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Where's Scully?!
You're lying.
What do you mean, walked?
How?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
Shush.
Okay.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Give a kiss to Edward.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
What difference does it make...?
Like hell "wait."
Little boy?!  That's him!
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
No problem.
He's beautiful...
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Sometime yesterday morning.
I'll get her...
No.
Give her some cigarettes.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
What's that?
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
I thought you wanted...
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Have you seen Calloway?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
Oh, the usual things...
Why are you lying?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
That's what we want to find out.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Yes.
Been here long?
When did you see him last?
No.
Best thing that ever happened...
You're not locking her up?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
I see.
Two thirty.
I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
She's been arrested.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
As long as they can use you?
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Hear the details.
I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Yes, sir.
Suppose I take...
His name?
I'm Daffy.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
What!
I'm sorry.
A bit fucking late.
You can swim?
Two.
No.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
They had Sabra and Shattila.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
You will.
Disease? What disease?
You want it to be an event.
What's he care about?
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
The sex is better.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'll go look....
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Notice? Like what...?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Why would Nadelman lie?
Give me a reason not to.
How do you reconcile the two?
But I wasn't.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
From the Rhineland originally.
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
What...?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Where?
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Four. But no one this important.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
What?
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Of course.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
I said that the file is incomplete.
The documents are forged.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn.  He is learning.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Dollars.
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
And... does the voice come back?
Try speaking to me?
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
What is it?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Lucky I was there to save you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
My wallet.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
I did?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm still here.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Promise you won't forget me.
Positive, Sir.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Again?
But... how is he going to breathe?
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
It's Esther.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
I said, do you come here often!?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Keep going.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Mordechai!
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Mazel Tov!
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
He's still working out some identity issues.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Worse.
Take a look.
Nice fellow?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
They don't say it to me.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
What arroyo - how did you get to it 
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
At four. He will be there at four.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Hey  I'm over here.
Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
More or less.
No.
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
That was a calamity!
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Now look what you've done.
I know. Funerals.
Yes.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
Will you please come with me?
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Arent you curious to know about Friedman?
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Have you finished?
No!
...You-you spoke to him?
Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.
Why do I feel I neednt answer that?
You bastard...
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Simplify and damn.
Im fine standing, thank you.
You...  Jesus Christ!
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
A criminal?
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Emily...
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
Where is he?
...On holiday?
Where are the kids?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Must I speak to you in French?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Anything at all?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
Should I come back in five minutes?
An Austrian.
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Er... Yes...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Tu sais o me trouver.
Youre sure he said his caller was a man?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
What do you mean?
Yes, my lord.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Good.
Tell the king to give me more men.
But... why... what's the point?
No...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Performing a miracle.
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Dead you're worthless, darling.
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Not long ago...
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
And may I go to Mass?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
For what?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Sooner is better than later!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Me too...
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
The clothes are not important...
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Yes... a half-steed... white.
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I... I never lied!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Really?
Yes...
And what does he say to you?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
What are you doing?
What?
Can you help?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
It certainly was.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Pig!
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
I am... I was a pianist.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Watch his hand
No sound at all?
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
The piano.
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
Yes, I suppose you would.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
Everyone has to practice.
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
It's quite safe, they are managing...
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
You got a bag or somethin?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
I had some appointments.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
There's always a depression on.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Who's got the contract?
Hackers.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
You mean you blew it.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
Did he hold you up on anything?
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Nice work, J.J.
Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Five and call.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Where you goin'?
Sixty-five.
2:00 A.M.
You doin' anything tonight?
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
I feel lucky tonight.
Yeh, he knows that.
So could Shaw.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Why don't ya then.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
Never heard of the place.
He was?
Is that what it means?
Do you suppose.....  ?
Don't cry.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Oh, here she is.
Shush!
Then what are you hiding?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Macaulay.
Why don't you try him again?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
He's all right.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
But it isn't bad weather now.
That woman!
Gilbert!
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Extraordinarily lucky.
He telephoned me today.
He did!
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
Goodbye.
I guess all the suspects are here.
I'll get some.
I never had it.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
Is Julia going with you?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
You're always teasing.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
Why tell me?
If you like 'em like that.
Santa Claus.
What are you drinking?
What are you going to do with it?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
Someone get a doctor.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
Maybe I will.
He was down in the shop.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
No.  Nobody but you.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Mimi...
I wish you'd tell me who.
Maybe she has.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
It's a fortune box.
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
He's not so--
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Let me see the map.
What do you figure it to be?
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I heard!
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
I've got no stomach for murder.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
What if I do?
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Wait.  Wait.
Invest it.
They're not going to--
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Millionaires, man.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I heard it click.
It's a mine, isn't it?
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
So where do we start?
What does it look like I'm doing?
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
He's not going to leave us.
How!?
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Yeah.
No!
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Probably.
And then shoot them.
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Is that good, or bad?
Why haven't they killed us!?
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Then I'm a rich man.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
How the hell should I know?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Really?
Just...want to be ready when we do.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Yeah.  So?
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
We got to get out of here.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
I think we found something.
I'm not wasting my water on him.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
Look,dirt!
No!  Don't go.
What?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
They're watching us now.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
What?
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
THX and me.
But you can't.  We must escape.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
I want you for my roommate.
But you can't...you.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
I don't care.
No......  She's dead THX........
You don't know that!
All right...
Save yourself....
Yes...
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
No thanks, Bev.
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Make up your mind, trigger.
I don't know.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
I know. I warned them.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
Look, it's important.
Insurance?
Don't talk.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
Quiet!
It's about this.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Sir, I--
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Report on the case so far.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Pull back. You're only an observer.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Very well, Jacques.
<u>Niente!</u>
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
You've never been in Constantinople?
But--
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Nice suit.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Just dull.
I don't want to see you at all!
Thank you.
Um-hum ...
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Now just a minute, Major--
Last year? It can't be that long.
The six--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Ah!
He recognized you!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Then you go into the foyer.
Not particularly.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
That's what you need!
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Um-hum ...
Together.
How do you like my dress?
Good night.
Like that?
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
I'm crazy about you!
Goodbye ... 
No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
Jacques!
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
But you're the more intelligent one.
But you saw it here.
The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
Thank you, Rose.
You're certain?
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
Rush her.
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
What do I tell your mother?
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
You're crazy.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
It is that simple.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
A whole ten cents?!
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
Jack, I --
It's okay. I'm alright.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Would you like anything?
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
Goodbye, mother.
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Thanks.
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
We'll be expecting you.
Nice lines--
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
How about giving me another coat?
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
When?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Make it five.
Jimmy!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Change?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Now you're talkin'!
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
On the drunk.
It's a pleasure.
Think again--
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
No--not quite.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Good night!
Why?
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Send that.
So what?
I thought I put you to bed.
That's fine.
I was never stiffer in my life.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Everything O.K.?
No--not much--excepting-- 
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Very serious?
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Somebody's got to do it--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Thanks to me.
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
I was in his cabin--
What!--are you crazy?
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Isn't that a daisy?
That's not what I meant.
I asked where you got him.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
Excuse me?
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Not half as bad as I feel.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Never even heard of anything like it.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
I know, me too.  What should we do About it?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
Oh, all right.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
I need it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
We'll see about that.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Yeah?
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
What're you talkin' about?
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
- We all want what we can't have?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
I see...
She married a hockey player.
We work in the dark. We do what we can.
That's reassuring.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
No.
Thanks.  Take care -
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
Let's not make it a habit.
No?
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Blood or Dutch?
You are seriously deranged.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
Of course.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
No -
...I see.
Thank you sir! Thank you!
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
Yes.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
I ought to break your damn neck.
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was nip and tuck.
Babe Brother.
He will be alright.
I'm going back home with Harry.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
It is just a regular card.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Hush.
It would be nice.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Only if you can spare it.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
You must have done something to her.
You invited me.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Where is Skip?
He is in his pigeon cage.
It is so considerate of you.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Right here in the van.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Excuse me.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Shield your eyes!
Don't tell me what to do!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Stay calm, everyone!!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Toss 'im overboard!
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
That's right.  Your toys.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Bad news?!
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
But you're Irish!
There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Let me in.
I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Nothing is left but us.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
Are you going to?
What do you think?
Just watching you.
Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
Yes.
Parents still together?
What's that mean?
Just watch.
What is this, like freebase?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
She ain't in on it.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
Arizona.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
You're breaking my heart.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
You will dine with me from now on.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I don't think you're going to do that.
Not in...
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Where?
What is the name of your informant?
Only if he can be trusted.
Noriega is a criminal.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
Any idea how much?
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
I guess you would, Franco.
Where are you going, Diane?
Great.
Out.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Jesus.
Is that a promise, then?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.
Smells like it.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
Clear?
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Now remember --
Right.
Nightmare.
Would not say no, would not say no.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Director?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Give me the gun.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
That's hardly a substitute.
Yeah.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
Where did she come up with that?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Six weeks and no sex?
But where?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
A Federation starship.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Ah, Captain?
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
Jim.
Goodnight, Bones.
I cannot be certain.
Damn.  Let's go.
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
Am I? We'll see.


Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
I cannot go with you.
Why not?
I don't understand...
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
I mean I want both of us to go.
Hello, Alan.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
If you think -
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Hah.
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Greetings, program...
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Tron...?
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Little more juice's all it needs...
We have to talk.
As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Okay, Dad.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
Yes.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Yeah, but for who?							*
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
So, it was your first time.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Uh, yes, it is important.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Why?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
I don't take those assignments.
Looks that way.
Dance?
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Hold that thought.
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Find out who this Renquist it.
You can't have just one.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
I didn't get any chicken.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
How 'bout me what?
There's nothing to tell.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
You bet. How much is that worth?
Five.
What would make you think that?
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Uh-huh.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Why Cancoon?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Heard that.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Tomorrow.
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
The zoo.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Um, nothing, let's go?
What are we gonna see?
Three kung fu movies.
What do you think, eightball?
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Yeah?
Get on your knees.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
No. No you're not.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
No. Not yet.
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Why does he trust you?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Keep it.
I give up. Who are you?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're no longer an extra -
He saw the wire.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Pussy love pink rocks.
Put it in your pants.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Yes.
Where's that?
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
What's she doing?
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
Give me the gun.
You're sure?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
You really want to know?
You want something?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
That a fact?
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I won't hold my breath.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
It is not.
But, in particular?
Where in Mexico would you like--
Nope.  Darrell.
Yep.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
You son of a bitch!
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Yes.  Yes it is.
What do you want?
What does it look like?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
I got it.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
You're welcome, Grace.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Least you can leave.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
A medicine man?
Lift me down.
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You love him?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
Jake.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
To get my car.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
Can you climb back up.
The trunk.  It's locked.
Accident.
I'm a solid man.
Where you headed?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Isn't that illegal?
About things.  About your wife.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
That's a bit much.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
You love her, but you hate her?
Drop it, Jake.
Trouble with the car again?
It's the truth, Jake.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Will you shut up!
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Stand up.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Nope.  No problems up the road.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
I didn't do anything.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
More or less.
Say, what happened to your hand?
I'm a solid man.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
So?
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
How much time?
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
Open up!
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
May I carry your package, Grace?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
How do you know he's still not here?
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
Which you don't have.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
What was that all about?
Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Oh?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Okay.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
We're supposed to be honest.
In college. A car accident.
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
Telling when people have done something wrong?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
Do you know why?
Is that right?
I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Against a window.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Nope.
Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
Advances?
Oh yeah.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
Like I said, I...
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
And?
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Jesus!
Huh?
Shut up, Kid.
Yeah?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
Eleven.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Two weeks, I guess.
Sally?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
You ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
Two more hogs got the fever.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
We done that stuff.
Yeah?
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
A glass of water would be nice.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
If you'll just let me -
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
I'11 be alright.
Hungarian?
I work for Keyser Sate.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Tell him we'll meet.
Two hours, tops.
I want to see him.
Where?
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
What call?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I said I never heard of him.
Because he was my friend.
No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Very good.
Yes.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Well, we...
...We did everything we could...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
What book is that?
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
I...yes.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
That's what I'd planned to...
There's nothing they can do to me.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right.  Who called?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
That's perfectly all right.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Defense...?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
The TV didn't work.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
You're going to stay here...?
You're talking like a drunk.
And what makes you so tough?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Where is he?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
You got a good memory, Franky.
I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Yeah.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
What did she do?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
I don't want a mistrial.
... I'm sure you do ...
... I understand ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
You live in the neighborhood?
Mrs. Simmonds.
One hour.
Yes, that's correct.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh.  And why is that?
Should I?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No.
It's not my line.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
I -- I --
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Mmm.
No? Then what?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
Yes.
Well, after all, it's "our place."
I need you.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
Scottie --
Take me away...
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
No...
When?
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
We have.
Shopping?
How can you be sure?
No.
Madeleine!
Where?
No... it's in shadow.
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
All the time.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
Yes?! But --
You can't.
Let me go.
To the church, I must go there.
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
What is her name?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
More than you think.
How do you know? Personal experience?
What do you mean?
It wasn't your fault.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Oh!
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
That's following a train of thought.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
I think I can lick it.
Who?
Do you know him well?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
You haven't told me everything.
Oh?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What is it, a still life?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
But you said grey, sir.
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
She's dead.
It's sacrilegious.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
It has worked.
They won't figure it out.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
No. I think it's fucked.
If anything ever happens to me...
What happened? Oh my God...
What does that mean?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
Not tonight.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He is not cracking up.
I just want to get married.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Isn't it a little late?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Okay fine.
And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Moore?
True.
Not true.
Israel doesn't have a King.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Not really, no.
Ball park sausages.
What?
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
Yup.
Yes.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
Why?
You can't play around with these tent people.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
He's weird.
Why? What's his problem?
With all my heart.
Okay.
You go down there.
We're leaving in three hours.
Yeah. Nesting.
Now?
What are you talking about?
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
What is it?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
Greenpeace?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
That's a good one.
So where to on the honeymoon?
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Are there many windows?
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
What's that?
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Don't you ever see him?
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Maybe ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Go away! Leave me alone.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
But why? Why?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Mother.
Good, then let's go!
I've had a gutful of this.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
You think he's smart?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
I'm still making adjustments...
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Do I get to see it or not?
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
Turn it down!
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
Help me get out of here.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
Enough!
I've been in prison, remember?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
Stop me.
You know I am.
You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
It's the White House.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
...the Harvester... 
And <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal Homecoming...?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
All I need is the one day.
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
And you?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
Who's gonna tell'em.
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
What are we gonna <u>do</u> about it...?
The War is Over.
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
How's your wife?
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>Every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> Old Shoe, our...
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Why Albania?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
They got to have something that we want.
What do we have that they want?
...it's a Teaser!
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Uh...
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't <u>care</u> -- I'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
What guards Us Against Canada...?
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A <u>shuck</u> -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
Jim Belushi...?
Why a beret?
Please, no thanks... 
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
The FAA announcement.
I met them before you were born.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
You sure?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
What was that?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Oh no, no...
So what firm you with, pal?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Excuse me.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You really do believe in destiny?
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Old values. Buy.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Ok toots, I will.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Hi there Sarah
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Of course you will.
That's not true.
Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
Then we both are.
You're joking.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Your friend saw them.
Do you?
Have you been hurt?
Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
Who's that?
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
I've seen you.  From the window.
This fence...it's so...
And then you weren't there.
Very much.
Thank you.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Um...sure.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Good.  I'm good.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Please.  That's all I need.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Why?
I know.
Not the focus.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Of course.
That's...
What's going on, Claire?
What?
What am I looking at?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Yep.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You told me that I was...
It's too rough.
What?
Oh God...
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
She can't be here without me.
How can you be sure?
Nothing.
I'm cooking you dinner.
Shhhh.
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Nothing worse than a common tool.
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
It wes a dream...!
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Anybody got a BP yet...?
FAST.
There are things you will not tell him.
Like this...?
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It is from love.
He fools around with his patients too.
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Doctor's orders- - -?
All I meant was -
What about you coming down here...?
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
I don't think of us that way - ever.
That's GREAT!
No.    This is unreal...
I love you too.
That's not funny.
Talking to me dear...?
- we made a fire.
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
Stop it!
Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
Go away, GODDAMNIT!
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
Papers...?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
No - not all the time - I mean
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
Sure...
I'm sorry?
I think I will pass...
I'm a dentist
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
What did you do with her?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
I have something I have to show you...
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Open it...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
No - I'll have you after
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
You and your pep talks.
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Well, Dad said...
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Check it out!
And some really fast cars.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
I love those springy head puppies!
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Yeah?
The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
I'm getting so good at this.
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
You ordered a Winnebago?
They're in the ignition, silly.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Hi ho, Silver.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
You mean they knew who I was?
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
Most places are, Jimmy.
Very funny.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Then I'll write about YOU.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Whatever.
Eventually you'll let go.
You're amazing.
I know.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Amen to that.
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
That's perfect.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
What about the blood?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
He was large?
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
He dropped Jimmy off first?
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
Yeah... okay... he did
I said he did.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
What?
Police -- God -- get a life.
You notice my new jumper?
No thanks to you.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
No you don't.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
You know what it takes.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
God, I've been calling you.
That's not your line.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
Will they?
You got something against cigarettes?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
That was the same thing Ray said.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Jim West.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Wouldn't dream of it.
Prepare what?
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
It's better than nothing.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
Yes, me!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
You tell me.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Philistine.
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Who was this partner of his?
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Right.
What is Tir Asleen?
It's a matter of great importance to me!
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Are you scared?
That's all I ever wanted!
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Just do it!
Somebody has to do it.
Shut up.
I don't know much about him.
Not one this big.
Oh sure, Fred.
They're Amish.
Just do it!
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Try the house.
Who'd you see?
Are they going to kill you?
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Have you got your gun on now?
Maybe.
You know who?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
How long have I been here?
But you can't.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
I'm coming.
Wrong.
I don't know where he is.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I have to help him!
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
You have no right here!
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Ohhh!
Oh --
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Oh, now?
How did you guess?
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
I knew you would!
You're right -- I am a coward.
The nerve.
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Ohhh!
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh -- does it hurt you?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
The other side....
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Who at?
What was that?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Now...
This way!  Come on!
Yeah --
You don't neither --
Yeah.
Ohhhh -- it's me!
No, sir!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
A heart --
Oh - look out.
You know something?
Now, now, don't fret.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
What the hell are you talking about?
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
The King pipeline.
Like riding a bike.
Perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
The worm on the hook again.
The inside man?
Is maybe...the inside woman.
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.
Its the only way out...
I know.
No. Youll be safe here.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
Not interested.
Where did you get this?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
A rope!
No!  Get me out!
Bond!
C-class.
Is it?
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What?!
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
No.  I just wanted you to --
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
Im not.
Then Ive been a very bad boy and youll have to spank me.  Christ!  Im doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.

His . . . whatever.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
That's because --
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Where did he go?
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
What new information?
What do you mean, frame-up?
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Then why don't you ask him?!?
What does this mean?  What does it --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
Maybe I'll do that.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
We're not after car thieves here.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
The scum of the Earth.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
What do you get if you finish?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Like what?
Yorgi asked me to.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I was invited. What's your story?
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
What's that?
You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
You're joking, right?
I'm through, Xander.
I can see that. Why?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I've seen a lot of rings.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Who?
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
To find Rogue.
I'll go.
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
It does indeed, Max.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Now wait a minute!
Yes, sir.
... No!
'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Baack!
What?
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
Call me from New York before you leave??
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Oh, nice.
Does that mean you love me?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Fron kon steen!
What?
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Vermicelli.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
Fron kon steen!
Are you putting me on?
I beg your pardon?
Why are you talking like that?
What wockers?
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
How?
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Don't fall for that one.
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Give -- me -- your -- hand!
You can say that again.
What did you find out?
There's only one way.
Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Inga, wake up!
But who was playing it?
Not fooling around.
I see what you mean.
Nor to Elizabeth.
And I have mine.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
