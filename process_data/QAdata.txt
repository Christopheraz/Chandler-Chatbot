C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!	All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.	Sounds like a date to me.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.	Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.	Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.	Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
Instead of...?	That's right.
No.	All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
And they weren't looking at you before?!	Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...	Cookie?
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?	Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!	And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.	(imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.	(re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
What, like there's a rule or something?	Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Yes!	Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.	Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.	I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey an	(deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.
I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.	It's a beautiful thing.
(picking up a leftover part) What's this?	I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Which goes where?	I have no idea.
Done with the bookcase!	All finished!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.	Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
You guys.	Oh, God.
You got screwed.	Oh my God!
Shut up!	You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
That only took me an hour.	Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.  You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.  Four years of closeness and 
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.	Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man, (looks to Chandler)	Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.	That is amazing.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.	If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
(entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.	Morning. Good morning.
Hello, Paul.	Hi, Paul, is it?
Shut up, and put my table back.	Okayyy! (They do so.)
Shut up, and put my table back.	All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
Look, it was a job all right?	'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)	You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.	And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!	Oh, how well you know me...
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...	Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)
Rachel! That was a library card!	Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Rachel! That was a library card!	(as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Oh, was I doing it again?	Yes!
(walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?	Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
I'm just serving it.	Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
I'm just serving it.	Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.	Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
Absolutely.	Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.	The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... bas
Pregnant?!	Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Whose little ball of paper is this?!	Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.	Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.	(looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?	Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
What?	Eeaagh!
Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!	and Joey: Oh! Yeah!
Doy! Probably right before she lost it!	You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...	...Dinah?
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!	Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
(puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.	Boys? We're going in.
Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)	Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
What does she mean by 'involved'?	I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.	What does she do?
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.	Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
Oberman: (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?	Yeah. Yeah. A little.
What are we supposed to be seeing here?	I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
(entering) Hi guys!	Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'	Ohh. Ouch.
Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.	Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Yeah. Cushions the blow.	Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Credits	So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.	Hey, that was really good!
Thanks! Let's keep going.	Okay. So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?
I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.	Smoke away.
I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.	I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
What?	Relax your hand!
What?	Not so much!
Whoah!	Hey!
Hey!	Alright, now try taking a puff.
Hey!	Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.	It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.	Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
Y'miss it?	Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
(carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!	Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.	Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
(puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?	Oh! Oh, God!
What is this?!	I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!	And this- is my reward!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.	Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.	Ohhh! Put it out!
Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.	All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.	Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.	What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Do you all promise?	Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Hi.	Hi, Alan.
...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.	Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?	Yeah!
Really!	Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
You know what I like most about him, though?	What?
The way he makes me feel about myself.	Yeah...
Well..	WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.	Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.	I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
A thumb?!	Eww!
I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!	Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?	Nooo!
Does, um, anyone wanna see?	Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!	Hey, this is so unfair!
Oh, why is it unfair?	So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the h
Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?	Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
(holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.	Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, 
Yeah.	Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
(entering) Hey. Where's Joey?	Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
(finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.	(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.	You're kidding. Oh my God.
(turns off the TV) Okay..	Oh! That was Lambchop!
I'm sorry..	(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.	Oh, yeah! Right!
(entering) Hi.	Mmm.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)	...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)	No no no!
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)	(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
(shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!	(returns) Yeah, alright.
Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?	Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. (Joey enters.)	Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.	You got waaaay too much free time.
(to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.	Happy birthday, pal!
So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?	Well, aren't we Mr. The glass is half empty.
What's wrong with the twentieth?	Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
The hell with hockey, let's all do that!	(trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
What are you doing?	(stops) I have no idea.
Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?	You got it.
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opens envelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler	(looking) Oh, this is not that bad.
Oh, by the way, great service tonight.	Oh! Yeah!
(to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)	...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)	We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Peach pit.	Yes, Bunny?
Actually, nectarines, but basically...	(to Joey) Could've been a peach.
(squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.	What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!	(to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!	He's open!
Pass it! Pass it!	Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Pass it! Pass it!	Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
Break	(to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
(holds up her handshe is on the phone) It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.	Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from t	Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel o
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.	Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...	Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...	Then what?
With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.	So in your whole life, you've only been with one(He gets a look too)oh.
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!	Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the(pause)wowww.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?	I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Really?	No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
(sarcastic) Oh, that's attractive.	Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. (Ross looks at Chandler for help.)	You gotta do it, man.
Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.	Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)	Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Oh, okay. Will you take my place?	Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.
(on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.	To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.	We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Credits	So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
No plans, huh?	Not a one.
Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?	Oh, right, right, shut up.
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.	No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward
You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.	Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.	Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
(on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.	Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.	It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.	Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?	Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
(sheepish) No.	Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.	There you go.
...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.	Where are they? Where are they?
This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.	It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Eww, I don't wanna do that.	Here we go.
Ok, have a good break-up.	Hey, Janice.
Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.	Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...(looks through he	What?
What?	(covering) What... did you get me there?
I got you...these. (pulls out a pair of socks)	Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.	That's great.
Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.	Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
(holding the full cup) No, no, I'm still working on mine.	That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.	Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.	Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.	Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
Ow!	Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.	(to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?	Oh, I don't know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.	I'm fine.
All right.	I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Wait here. Breathe.	How do you do that?
It's like a gift.	We should always always break up together.
Oh, he needed some time to grieve.	I'm free! I'm free!
(reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!	You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)	you want is a dingle,   What you envy's a schwang,   A thing through which you can tinkle,   Or play with, or simply let hang...
Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?	(staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
Is it? Feels like two.	No, ten o'clock.
What?	(sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
Oh. Hel-lo!	She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.	Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!	Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.	Thank you, buddy.
You could do that!	Y'think?
You could do that!	Yeah!
You could do that!	Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
C'mon! C'mon!	Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
...Yes?	Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
Yes, you said that.	Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she 
Chandler?	Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
Whadja think?	...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.	(admitting) Saw your head. Saw your head.
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.	(running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it bet
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!	Hey, kids.
Based on this play? ...Based on this play!	Hey.
(reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.	Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?	It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of y	Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of y	We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.	Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
Who's Rick?	Who's Rick?
My husband.	Ooooohhh.
My husband.	Oh, so you're divorced?
No.	Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
No, I'm still married.	So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.	Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.	What?!
Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.	So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
I suppose mainly sexual.	...Hm.
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.	What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?	Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!	Yeah! C'mon!
Tah-daaah!	Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Well, whaddya think?	Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.	Uh-oh...
(to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.	Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.	Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
(on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pa	Oh my God! Whoah!
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!	Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)	Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!	C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
Who is being loud?	Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?	Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?	No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like tha
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...	God, I love these fingers...
Thank you.	No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
(moves Chandler's arm and look at his watch.) Oh my God, I'm late. (She starts to get up.)	Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
Okay.	Don't go.
Okay. Oh no, I have to.	(to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
(getting up and dressing) I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.	Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
It's not Rick.	What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
No, it's-it's Andrew.	I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
He's... new.	Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
No, that's not exactly what I was..	Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
So what do you want?	You.
You have me!	Nono, just you.
Whaddyou mean?	Lose the other guys.
...Like, ...all of them?	C'mon, we're great together, why not?
Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.	...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every
So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?	I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
Which one?	...The second guy.
(gets up to leave) Well, call me if you change your mind.	Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?	Hey!
No? What happened, big guy?	(to Ross) Big guy?
I got fired.	Oh!
My mom will.	Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.	Night.
Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much.	Oh, great. This is just...
Well, I never call me.	Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
(on phone) Hi Mom, it's Jill.	She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idio
(on phone) Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.	Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
(on phone) I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.	Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
That had to hurt!	Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
That had to hurt!	There you go!
That had to hurt!	You're definitely scaring here.
(awkwardly) Would you like to call somebody? (offering phone)	Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
Hello?	Hey, it's me.
(to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?	Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
What?	I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I have no idea what you just said.	(angry) Put Joey on the phone.
What's up man?	I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
(to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)	Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.	Whoooaa!
Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'	No way!
You did not go!	Come on.
Would you like some gum?	Um, is it sugarless?
(checks) Sorry, it's not.	Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
(nonchalantly) Yeah?	You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 
(smiling) You betcha!	(chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
(smiling) You betcha!	Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
(smiling) You betcha!	Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
My God, you're choking! (she runs over and gives him the Heimlich, the gum flies from his mouth) That better?	(gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.	OK.
Well, this has been fun.	Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. (she kisses him on the cheek) See ya.	Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Hey gorgeous, how's it going?	Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.	Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?	Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-	He's a he?
Credits	...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...	You did?
Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.	Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.	You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...	Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...	Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...	Yeah! Right!
I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...	WHAT IS IT?!
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.	Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.	Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
Now she's passed.	I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
Geller: I'd like that.	Hey, gorgeous.
(sheepish) Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-	No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
Oh! Okay! Phew!	So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...	...Quality, right, great.
Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.	Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
What? He's cute!	Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
Is Brian...?	No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.	Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
(entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?	Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
What?	Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)	You're watching a football game at a funeral?
No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.	You are a frightening, frightening man.
I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)	God! Ross!
Geller: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. (Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears)	Oh, no-
Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.	Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
...Chandler!	Hey.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?	Who are those people?
Credits	Hey, Lowell.
Hey, Chandler.	So how's it going there in Financial Services?
It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?	Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
I know. That's what I told her.	Really.
Yeah.	So- you can tell?
Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.	So you don't think I have a, a quality?
Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.	He is?
Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)	Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
Hey, hey.	Hey.
Hey.	And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.	That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.	Do you know which one you're gonna be?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)	Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.	Yes, every single one of them.
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.	I thought it was $98.50.
Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear 	I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?	All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.	We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced
Oh my god.	Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.	Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.	Oh, you must stop shooping.
Chandler, will you just come in already?	No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!	Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!	The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?	No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the 
I can't, I gotta go.	Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
No, no, no, you said, got the keys.	Do either of you have the keys?
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?	(sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of 	Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Stop it, stop it, stop it!	Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
It's nice that he has someone.	Shall I carve?
By all means.	Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
The bigger half.	I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it 
The bigger half.	That's so sweet.
And a crappy New Year.	Here, here!
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.	Oooh!
That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?	Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.	Might wanna open with the snowman.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.	Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.
Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?	Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!!
Yeah, you wish!	It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah, you wish!	Yeah, okay. Alright.
Yeah, you wish!	Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Yeah, you wish!	Woooo! Yeah!
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!	(Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... an	Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?	Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!	I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!	I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.	Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)	Aah, y'killing me!
I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...	Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.	Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.	Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
You know more than one Fun Bobby?	I happen to know a Fun Bob.
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...	That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.	Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
What, uh... what juggling thing?	With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No.	Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)	You remember Janice.
(Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!	(Imitating) But you found me!
Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!	Kill me. Kill me now.
(Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.	Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
Oh, no. Oh, no.	I'm sorry you misunderstood...
Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)	Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
There y'go, kids.	(To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
You seen Sandy?	Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.	(in the kitchen) What?
Clark: (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...	And the moment of joy is upon us.
Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!	Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.	Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
I know.	Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Leno: (on TV) Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.	Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
C'mon, she's your mom!	Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!	Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.	You can say that because she's not your mom.
Your mom was arrested?	Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Bing: (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...	Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
Bing: (on TV) ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...	Shhh.
Bing: (on TV) ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.	THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Bing: (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...	Awww!
Bing: (on TV) Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...	This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Bing: (on TV) Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.	...And then he burst into flames.
Bing: I am famished. What do I want... (Looks at Chandler's menu)	Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?	Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Bing: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. (They both sit down) Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.	I know I am.
Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.	Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!	What are you guys doing out here?
Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.	Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)	Oh my God.
You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.	I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm	What?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, c	(To Joey) You knew about this?
Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.	I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Thanks, man, big help.	(To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
I wasn't- I mean, I-	Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
I know-	I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
Me neither, y'know what-	I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Chandler-	You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
(Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!	What was that?
Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...	Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.	Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?	Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
(To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.	That's very funny. We done now?
No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?	That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?	No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Bing: Alright, well, be good, I love you. (Kisses him and goes to leave)	You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Bing: (Reentering) O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.	Really stupid.
Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?	Yeah. No. No...
Bing: You okay, kiddo?	Yeah, okay.
Bing: Alright. (Kisses him)	Nice save.
Bing: Mr. Geller.	Hey.
You mean that?	Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
Yeah? How'd it go?	Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Well, howdya feel?	Pretty good! I told her.
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!	Nooo!
	No-no-no-no, we're done.
Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)	And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
I know...	(to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...	Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.	You think?
(on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and Susan laugh)	Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.	What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?	Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?	Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?	What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah	You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?	Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?	I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right	Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!	It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?	Aw, don't do that
Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.	Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!	More coffee over here, please!
Thanks Rach.	So what are you gonna do?
You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)	Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)	That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, Uh-oh, I'm outside again? Of course!	(gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, Hello, sit here, eat something.	You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?	Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!	Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
Paolo made a pass at me.	So, what do you think?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.	I know!
Come on, two on one.	What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo	My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what 
I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!	Wha-
Hey!	Hey!
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!	Yeah, get out!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) 	(to Joey) One more game?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock	I'm sorry!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!	Rachel, wait, wait.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!	Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!	That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?	Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?	Okay.
Did I, uh, did I miss something?	No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?	It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.	Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.	Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.	Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.	Huh.
I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.	Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?	Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chand	(Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.	Y'know, I don't see that happening?
C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.	Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
C'mon up.	(Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
Yeah.	Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
Night, you guys.	Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?	Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstr	Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...	So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.	C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by No thanks, it's late.
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!	Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.	Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm loo	Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.	No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts t
You really think so?	Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)	Get off!
I thought it was Chandler!	(Comes out of his room) What? What?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!	Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!	Hey, Pheebs.
I dunno, there's just something about...	Basically we just feel that he's...
We hate that guy.	Yeah. Hate him.
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?	...No, we hate him.
Wow.	Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.	If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
(entering) Hey.	Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.	Awww.
Yeah, right.	Aaawwwwww!!
She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.	Any contact?
Hey. (stutters something incoherent)	Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.	I think it's winning.
I think it's insane.	She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Think it'll work?	No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.	Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.	Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Hi. She said yes.	Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
(Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?	Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.	...And what did you bring?
She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.	Janice?
Oh.... my.... God.	(angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
Oh.... my.... God.	Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.	Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
(at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.	That's OK.
(to Lorraine) We can't do that.	(disgusted) What? What can't you do?
Uh, we might be leaving now.	Tell me it's you and me we.
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.	Ok, you can not do this to me.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.	I hope she throws up on you.
I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.	So...
Just us.	Oh, what a crappy night!
Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.	Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
So, do we have the best friends or what?	Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
I will go for that drink.	You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Each.	That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?	No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Hi, Monica.	Ok, well, this was very special.
Oh my god. Janice, hi!	Janice is gonna go away now.
(in disbelief) Whoa.	Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...	How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.	Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
Hello, funny Valentine.	Hi, Just Janice.
I brought you something.	Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.	Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
That's fine.	(surprised) It is?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.	Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.	Oh, no I don't.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?	I did, but...
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See 	Call me!
Chandler.	Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Tedlock: Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.	Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...	Hey!
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...	Hey!
What's going on?	What is it?
What's going on?	So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
What's going on?	That's great!
What's going on?	So.... I quit.
What's going on?	Why?
What's going on?	Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.	If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
So was it a lot more money?	It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
... the WENUS?	Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
So what're you going to do?	I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....	Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?	Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!	Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?	Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the a-gogo.
Career counselor?	Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
I don't!	Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.	Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?	Who are you going out with?
Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.	And he's not speaking metaphorically.
My God! What happened to you?	Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for 
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!	Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
(brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.	Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.	(tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.	You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...	(smiling)....with??
You're not going to believe this!	It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.	Again?
And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.	(on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, t
And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.	Well?
(excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.	Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
Oh! You have a window!	Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!	(walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
(sitting) OK.	This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
(sitting) OK.	Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
(sitting) OK.	Last time I do that, I promise.
Yeah, where the hell is he?	(on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, becaus
	This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?	Its Phoebe! Hi!
Hi. Okay, will that be all?	Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.	Can we start over?
Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here. (She wanders away.)	and Joey: No, no, no!
Ive never done that.	All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
Im sayin I see a difference.	Theyre twins!
I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!	You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Yeah.	Lets not do that any more.
Yeah.	Hey guys! Hey!
Okay, look, this could be a really long game.	Your sister Ursula.
(Her face dropping) Oh, really.	Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Rifts. Yeah, I know.	Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
Oh, Pheebs, Im sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.	Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.	And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.
(Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.	Oh, okay. Send her in.
Hi.	Hi, Nina. Come on in.
You wanted to see me?	Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
Which is bad, because?	Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Your... excuse me?	WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... wenus.	Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
(looking at the remote) How did he do this?	(Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Well, someone was supposed to write Rach, take down the lights and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monicas note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?	Hey, where you been?
I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.	Score.
She is so hot!	Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.	Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
Douglas: Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.	And?
Douglas: Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.	So what does this mean?
Douglas: Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department.	Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &amp;ndash;
Douglas: Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?	Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
Are you okay?	(Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
(Taking her hand away) What?	(Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?	Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.	Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
and Chandler: Hey.	You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
Yep. Ice Capades.	Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
Okay.	Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Okay.	And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Douglas: (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Ninas shapely departure) Shes still here.	Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
Douglas: (Shutting the door, then pointing vaguely at Ninas shapely departure) Shes still here.	And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Douglas: Youre kidding? She seems so...	Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at al
Douglas: Thats unbelievable.	And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Douglas: I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.	Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?	You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Do you have a sec?	Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.	Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.	Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
I am?	Sure, why not?
Oh my god! (Rushing over to give him a big hug) Youre amazing!	Oh, you dont know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
What?	Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
What?	Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Oh, howd she take it?	Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the de
I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...	Youre not gonna lose him.
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.	and Joey: That's nice.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.	What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, tha	Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?	Well, only if you order stuff.
You take your time.	There it is! So what're you gonna do?
What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.	And your friend Phoebe?
Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?	Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!	Alright, what have we learned so far?
Oh...	(Reading) Happy Birthday Peehe.
(Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I lo	Did you see Betty?
(as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.	Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
Uh-huh.	Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
Do you have a point?	You know, you think I would.
Do you have a point?	What's up with the simian?
It's just a fur ball.	Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.	No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
What's goin' on?	Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.	We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.	(Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, why?	Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?	Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
Hey, guys.	and Ross: Hey.
(grabs the bill) Give me that!	You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?
I don't know.	Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... (begins to stare lovingly at Rachel)	...little playthings with yarn?
What?	Could you want her more?
Who?	(sarcastically) Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening.
Shut up!	We're notwe're not saying anything.
Thank you.	(to the girls) We were playing poker, alright...
Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'	And then he did.
Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?	There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
No.	(teaching) OK, so now we draw cards.
Congratulations!	OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...(look of realization)	(changing subject) OK, so at this point, the dealer...
But... I'm ready, so, just deal.	OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. (holds up two cards) Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. (Joey is unamused) Alright babe, deal the cards.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!	Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Settle what?	The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
(pause)...Yeah.	Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Alright boys, let's eat.	Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
You still on that?	Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? (mimicking): When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!
Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!	Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?
Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is 	That's great! That's wonderful!
Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.	Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?
Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.	That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie.
You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?	Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Chandler?	Couldn't be more out. (throws in cards)
Let me see! Show them!	Y'know, I've had dates like this.
I'm in for fifty cents. (throws it in)	Call.
That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?	(to Ross): What do you need, what do you need?
Fifteen.	Alright, here's ten. (gives it to him)
Thank you.	Good luck.
(to Ross): Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.	(to Ross): I thought we had them!
Credits	Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)	Go.
Suck-fest.	Toootal chick-flick.
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.	They're still just friends, right?
'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.	I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.	I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...	I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.	Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
(Entering) Hey.	Hi.
Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?	Rachel lost Marcel.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?	Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.	Marcel?
Marcel?	Marcel?
No. 1: Hi, can I help you?	Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
A monkey.	Yes have you seen any?
No. 1: Just a sec. (To Chandler and Joey) Hope you find your monkey. (She starts to shut the door)	Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?	Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could 	Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
Marcel?	Marcel?!
That's because I'm in front of them.	Eh. I thought that was an alp.
I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.	Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
	I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
Oh, that is so sick.	I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Credits	I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
So have you called her yet?	Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? (The girls make disgusted noises.) It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? (To the guys) I'm right, right?
Oh, God, just do it! (Grabbing the phone.) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!	Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. (Calls her, then hurriedly hangs up.) I got her machine.
Her answer machine?	No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
So, uh, why didn't you say anything?	Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase Yes indeedy-o.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!	(bluffing) And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!	Oh!... Right!
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (Rachel enters.) Oh!	Hey Rach!
Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?	Yes!
Why?	I have my reasons.
Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here...	(on phone, reading from a script) Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. (Rattles some dishes) Bye-bye. (Hangs up.) Oh God!
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!	Hey, I've been honing!
What was with the dishes?	Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.	What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.	Can I use your phone?
Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.	Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?
Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.	Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
...desperate, needy, pathetic?	Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
How many beeps?	She answered.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.	I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.
Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.	Hey! Hi!
Please. If she said to you, Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now, what would you say?	If it helps, I could slide over.
(leaving) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?	Hello? Hello?
(on phone) Hello?(Listens) Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? (Listens) Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. (Listens) Really? (Listens) Oh. (Listens) Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorr	So how's Mindy?
Brrrrrrr!	Hell is filled with people like you.
Get down?	...And boogie!
Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (Rachel exits and slams the door in his face.) That'	Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?	Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just call her?	I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Do you?	No! (Calls) Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! (Listens) I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. (Listens) Oh, u
Don't you have to pee?	'S'why I'm dancing...
Four letters: Circle or hoop.	Ring dammit, ring!
(entering) Hey, you know our phone's not working?	What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.	(investigating) I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?	Nngghhh!!!!!!!
(entering) Chandler?	Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.
(entering) Chandler?	Hi. Hi.
(entering) Chandler?	What are you doing here?
Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure y	...I'm, I'm okay.
Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?	That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
You got it.	Okay.
G'bye, everybody.	Bye.
Second date!	...I dunno.
You don't know?!	Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.	Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
What? It's, it's just a phase.	Well, that's what we said about Joey...
This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.	How about Joey... Pepponi?
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.	Joey... Switzerland?
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.	Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.	Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
(Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.	Might wanna try Joseph.
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!	Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
(Mortified) Hi.	and Joey: Hey.
At the vet.	She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.	So what does this mean?
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!	I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?	I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he'	Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Hey. We found her, we found the girl.	What?
Nope. We took her to lunch.	Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.	...Take off their hats!
(entering) You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?	You're kidding.
Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!	Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.	and Joey: He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...	...He's in.
Oh!	Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.	Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. (They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room)
Shut up!	Tell me what?
Look at you, you won't even look at him.	(sarcastically) Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Doing it on this table. (points at the table)	Wow!
Why, why, why would you dream that?	More importantly, was I any good?
Well, you were pretty damn good.	Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. (Monica pats him on his lap)
I love it, when we share.	You're okay there?
I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.	I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Credits	Hello Rachel.
Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.	Pirates again?
Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.	(sarcasticly) Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
What... I could, I could do it. What is it?	Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. (Ross looks at her.) It's a whole big boob story.
I could be a secretary.	Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.	A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
He's... our age.	When we were?
College?	Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.	What?
There you go.	Can you hear that?
(plays with a thumbtack remover) Yeah?	See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
(with a deep voice) Mr. Bing's office. (Listens) No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.	I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Will he know what this is in reference to? (Listens) And he has your number? (Listens) All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.	What?
Ross says hi.	Ah!
This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?	Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Most likely. (raises and goes toward the door) Okay, I'm gonna be out there.	Okay.
All right. Bye bye.	Bye bye.
All right. Bye bye.	(answering it) Yes?
Whatcha doin'?	Ooh. (leans against the desk)
Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.	See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. (Joey and Ross wonder what he means) Me.
No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.	Why not?
Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.	What?!
I thought you knew that.	Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.	What are you talking about?
Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like Mr. Boss Man. You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, Boss Man Bing.	I can't belive it.
Yeah, yeah. They even do you.	They do me?
You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'	I don't sound like that.
Joey, and Ross: 'My scones.'	Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Joey, and Ross: 'My scones.'	That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Ethan: Who?	Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
No, forget it.	Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?	(shouting) Mon!
No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.	And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Stegosaurus!	Tyrannosaurus!
Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.	Work people? Nobody told me.
No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.	You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.	You think I should?
I really do, yeah.	Okay.
Okay.	Okay.
Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.	I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
You were great. But they still made fun of you.	What?
You know, now you're more like, you know like, Mr. Caring Boss, Mr., you know, I'm one of you, Boss, Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!	Then, I don't get it.
Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.	They do?
Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.	I just wan't to...
No, but you can't.	But I just wa...
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.	Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
No problem.	You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Petrie.	Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.	(doing a little dance) Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
For the ride.	Yeah, like in a cab...
Save it.	Okay, hating this.
All right, I'm going. I'm going.	Here we go, here we go.
I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.	Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
What, it's ok when Chandler does it?	You have to pick your moments.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.	I used to have that bumper sticker.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.	(to Rachel) You see what I mean.
I want a baby.	Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.	Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?	You'll get one.
Oh yeah? When?	All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?	Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?	No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?	(trapped) Uh, uh.
Well?	Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. (Pause) What if the baby needs him?	Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?
Yeah, why?	No reason. (turns around, makes an 'Oh my God' gesture with his eyes)
Break	Help!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. (Listens) Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. (Listens) No, he's gone. (Listens) No no, you don't have to fly back, really. (Listens) 	Where have you been?
Oh, just had a baby.	Mazel tov!
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.	(to Joey) You are really frightening me.
Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.	Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. (they pull her hand off of him) Uh, that's great. (looking around) Anybody seen a nipple?
(to Ross and Susan) Wait! You forgot your legs!	Push, push!
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!	Good luck!
All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!	(to nurse) Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.	I know, I still am one of these.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away l	And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)
You guys wanna get some coffee?	Yeah.
Pardon?	Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. (walks over to where Joey is seated)
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.	Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.	(sigh)... And where's this money coming from? (gives money to Joey)
We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... (hands meat to Monica)	(in a deep voice) Men are here.
We make fire. Cook meat.	Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.	Crazy bitch.
Hey!	Hey!
No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?	Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?	Forget about her.
He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.	Course there, they just call it food.
We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. (Joey gives Ross a hug)	I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.	(sarcastic) Ooooh. (looks dumbfounded at Joey's stupidity)
Well, thank you, Melanie.	(pointing out a gift) OK, this one right here is from me.
There is a little child inside this man!	Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Who's this from?	Oh, that's Ross's.
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he	Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)
I can't believe he did this.	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?	(panicked) ahem... um... Crystal duck.
No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?	(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Oh.... my God.	(rubbing his temples) Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
I know. This is really, really huge.	No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.	OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)	(quickly) H-He's in China!
No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.	What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?	Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!
I-I-I don't know.	Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)	Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! (she leaves)
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?	Hey, big...
Shhhh!	(quietly) ...spender.
She's still asleep.	So how'd it go?
Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?	The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!	Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another l	I didn't know you had another level.
Seven hundred bucks!	Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.	Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.	No way!
Guys, you got your hair cut.	Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
(entering, out of breath) Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.	Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
(out of breath) Julie.	Ohh. (Happily) Hi!
Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.	Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
Thank you.	Hey, Rach, can I get...
Did you talk to him?	Not yet.
Then, no.	So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?	God?
It was you, pal.	Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it h	Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Go-go-go-go, come on! (Ross goes over to the counte) (to Chandler) So uh, what did you find out?	He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.
How is that the silver lining?	You have to really wanna see it.
(on phone) Hello? Hi.	(entering) Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
Needs some clothes altered?	No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. (still confused) All right, when was 1990?	Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. (Ross comes by, smoching with Julie on the phone.) I gotta get out of here. (Exits)	Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.	What stupid thing did you do?
Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.	People do stupid things when they're upset.
My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...(Everyone looks at her), but this is about your horrible mistake.	Hi!
(to Paulo) Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.	Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.	Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
How long do you want the cuffs?	At least as long as I have the pants.
Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.	(entering, angry) Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? (Pause) Your tailor is a very bad man!
(entering from the bedroom) Hey, what's goin' on? (Pats Chandler on the shoulder which causes him to jump.)	Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.	Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
What?	Cupping.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.	Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...	That's ok.
I guess so. (Carol starts to breast feed Ben.)	You know, it's... (sees the feeding taking place next to him) something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. (Goes into the kitchen)
(following them into the kitchen) What are you guys doing?	We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Carol?	Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Chandler?	So, uh, how often can you do it?
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?	No thanks.
(enters) Hi, honey.	Hey, sweetums.
Hello to the rest.	Hi!
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?	Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. (Squirts some on her wrist and tastes it.)	What did you just do?
What is the big deal? (Tastes the breast milk.)	What did you just do?
No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.	Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
(he rolls up his sleeve) Gimme the bottle. (Joey hands him the bottle and Ross squirts some on his arm.) Gimme the towel. (Joey gives him the towel and he wipes it off.)	Howdy.
(sitting on the otherside of the counter from Chandler) Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.	Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. (Chandler pours some juice in a glass.) You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.	(slides the juice across the counter which Joey catches) What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. (He downs the glass of juice in one swig.) I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve	(pours more and slides the refill to Joey) All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
Yeah I guess you're right.	You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
I'm gonna do it. (He downs the juice in one swig again.)	All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
	Hey.
So how was Joan?	I broke up with her.
So how was Joan?	They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.	I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It	You or me?
You guys are messin' with me, right?	Yeah.
You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.	Maureen Rosilla.
All right, bye-bye.	Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!	Ok, Phoebe.
Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.	Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
Have you ever seen so much crap?	Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?	Hey, look at this. My Big Book of Grievances.
Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.	April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.	Wow, he looks so normal.
Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.	Funniest? Heckles?
That's what it says.	Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
I'd call that excessive.	Whoa!
What?	Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
So, you were both dorks. Big deal.	I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Have you been here all night?	Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. 
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.	Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.	What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it supposably?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.	How do you know that? How?
I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.	You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?	Yeah, I understand.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?	You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.	(on phone) Hi, it's me.
Janice? You called Janice?	Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
You remember Janice, right?	Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Helloo!!	Oh, my, god!
Hey, it's everybody.	Janice, you're--
Yes, I am.	Is it--?
Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.	Congratulations.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.	You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.	Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.	Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
Uh huh. Why is that?	If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. An
You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.	Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.	In a bad way?
You are ready to make a commitment!	Whoa! Don't know about that.
That's fine.	Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in 
Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?	I'll take that.
You want his yearbook?	Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
It's really not that big!	Takin' that with you, huh?
You comin'?	Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see Philosopher wanted?	Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list fiv
Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.	Huuh.
Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.	I didn't know it was a big secret.
You have a third nipple?	You bitch.
Whip it out, whip it out.	C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.	Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.	Joey was in a porno movie.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.	Huuh.
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.	If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?	Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.	Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.	Woah.
The Ice Capades?	No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
[holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?	Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. [hands her a bowl and kisses her]	Uh, Julie.
Yeah?	Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
Hi everyone.	Hi.
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .	What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.	OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's 	Nice work my friend.
That saves us a conversation.	Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?	I got the time to get to know Julie.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?	I'm goin' home.
Man, I sure miss Julie.	Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (phone rings)
You ever figure out what that thing's for?	No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda	What?
I got a little drunk...and naked.	Bob here.
I got a little drunk...and naked.	(on phone) What've you been up to?
Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.	Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.
I know.	I'm back.
So, are we gonna get together or what?	Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
Great, I'll see you then.	Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.	I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.	Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
(on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.	Hi, Julie!
(sarcastically) Hi, Julie.	Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?	Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
Do we need a cake?	Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
Yeah, whoosh!	But it's Ross.
All right.	I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?	You know, I think I might just.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.	Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.	We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.	All right.
Go.	Hi.
Hi.	Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
Yes?	Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
How did you--?	I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
Thanks.	No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
What are these, like famous chickens?	Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?	Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.	I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
Anything else?	Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.	Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
Yeah.	You can tell us.
I hear ya.	We can talk about that.
That's a good point.	So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?	No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
All of us.	Together.
Yeah.	So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Yeah.	Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?	By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Come on.	Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.	If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.	Why did you look at me when you said that?
Fine.	Fine.
Chandler!	Yeah?
Geez! Are you ready?	Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Whoa! You had sex today?	Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Wow.	Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Still doing the screening thing?	I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.	Bob here.
Oh, hi.	So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.	So, uh, how was he?
Eh.	Eh?
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	Well, that makes me feel so good.
(silently mouthing) Bumpy?	Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.	So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Excellent, that was excellent.	I can't believe the guys missed this.
Ross.	Chandler.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.	Yeah, we really missed you guys.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?	Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
It's work.	I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
(on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.	I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
And you feel like we hold you back.	Yes.
Oh!	No.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.	You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)	Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries. When he moves Ben away, he stops crying.)
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?	Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.	We'll watch him.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?	I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Consider it done.	You understood that?
Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue.	Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
(singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.	You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one	No, I got him.
No, seriously.	Oh, seriously you want him?
And who is this little cutie pie?	Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
I think it's great you guys are doing this.	Well, we are great guys.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!	That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Hey, hey, look at that talent.	(to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
1 ON BUS: Hey, you. He's just adorable.	Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.	You done?
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.	You know it?
1: So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?	Oh, sure, they love us over there.
2: Where's your baby?	AND JOEY: (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben!
2: Where's your baby?	Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)	(on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do rea
(singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!	AND JOEY: Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
AUTHORITY GUY: He's here. (Chandler and Joey hug each other in relief) I'm assuming one of you is the father.	That's me.
I'm him.	Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)
(but to different babies): Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!	Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.	Ok.
Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.	Yeah?
Yeah.	Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
Ahh!	What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.	Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
You got a better idea?	All right, call it in the air.
Heads.	Heads it is.
Yes! Whew!	We have to assign heads to something.
Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.	What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.	(looking fearfully at Joey) Hey, he's not crying.
Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?	You, you are gonna love this.
Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.	Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!
	OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?
So, how was the party?	Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.	Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?
Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.	Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
Please.	C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Please.	Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.
TITLES	OK, let's do it. [Monica looks at him funny] What?
Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.	And we're changing. [jogs back in his apartment]
C'mon give me five more. Five more.	[weakly] No.
Five more and I'll flash you.	One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Five more and I'll flash you.	[slowly lifts coffee cup to his mouth] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [slowly sets the cup back down] Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. [Joey intercepts the cup and puts it down for him]. She's insane, the woman is in
Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.	Sorry Phoebs.
[to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.	Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.	So you really OK about all this?
Hi guys.	Hey.
BREAK	No, no, no, no, no, no [opens door to Monica] No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Why not?	Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
OK, if you say stop, then we stop.	OK, stop.
CREDITS	Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.
No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.	OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?	Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.	I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know.	You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
[sad] Uh-huh.	And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well no, but um.	I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .	So, you feel like goin' for a run?
Alright.	Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.
OK. Just for a little while.	OK. [Puts an afghan over her and dances into his room]
Credits	All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?	[doggedly] Games and stuff.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.	Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]	Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.	Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for e
Can't we just use a pen?	No, Amish boy.
And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but 	Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.	Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?
Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!	I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?
Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.	[in phone] So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's that?	[nervous] What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?	No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey, rattled] Hey, it's printing!
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?	Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
And I'm in it? Then let me read it.	JOEY, ROSS: No!
Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?	[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end.
What is this? Ross, what is this?	Good luck.
No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?	My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.
What?	Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.
What were you thinking?	[squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.
Yeah. You!	All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Oh, yeah, I do.	What are you doing out there?
That's what I said.	Look, maybe we should go?
Hey.	Hey.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?	Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.	And twenty-five it is.
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.	Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.	Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey guys.	MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.
Hey guys.	MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.
Hey guys.	What's in the bag?
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.	Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
Oh.	Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd s
Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.	Who said anything about Christmas?
She told us.	So whaddya got there Monica?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?	Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Phoebe here with the cab yet?	Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.	Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, here she comes.	Hey.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.	Eeeshk.
OK, let's go.	OK.
Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]	OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.	[grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]	[Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!
Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]	Oh, so that's what this is for.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.	Yeah.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.	Alright.
Mailbox.	Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you kno	Well, so why not go knock?
Yeah?	Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.	Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.	Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!
Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.	Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.	OK, Phoebs, your turn.
You got me a cola drink?	And, a lemon lime.
Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.	And last but not least.
Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.	OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...	Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
See ya. [exits]	Bye! See you later!
I had one glass.	I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
[sad] Ooohh, why?	Hey.
Hey.	Guess who's back in show business.
Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?	No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.
Oh, no.	OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.
Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.	Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]	Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Hi.	[turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Alright.	[to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross] Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.	You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
[upset] She's dating. She's dating.	Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.	Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
....................Yeah.	Hey.
Hey.	Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.
Well, the part's mine if I want it.	Oh my God!
Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.	[not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.	So, what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?	Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.
I've never slept with someone for a part.	Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]
Sorry.	It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.	Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'kno	Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
[grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.	Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.
[condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.	And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.
You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.	OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?	No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?	Me.
Why would I have to sleep with you?	It's my game. You want the job or not?
Why would I have to sleep with you?	Hey.
[holding bottles] Does anybody want these?	I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.	So what'd you do?
Hi.	Oh, hey.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.	Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Hey.	Hey!
If you wanna call that a reason.	[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.	Whoa, she's pretty.
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you k	Oh, ok.
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.	Nice!
Excellent!	For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
All right, all right. Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!	That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No no, that's me.	Oh, yeah.
Oh my god.	That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.	Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.	Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.	Believe me, sometimes that happens.
Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?	You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
That's him.	Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!	Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna crea	Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.	Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
I miss Rose.	Oh, yeah?
Ok, that's so nice.	[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]
Ok.	[to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.]
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]	Isn't Ben in this?
I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]	Oh, yeah!
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.	Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.	Rhythm?
No, my first fan mail.	Alright!
Hey guys.	Hey.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.	You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?	Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. [both laugh hysterically]
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?	Hello.
Never mind, it's open.	[Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Let's get out of here.	The one time they're not home.
Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?	Wait, wait, wait. [Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding]
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.	Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
AND MONICA: Yeah.	Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
And she's not crazy?	Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.	Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve l
OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe	Hi Phoebe.
Excellent!	Very informative!
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.	That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
OK, hi again.	Hi Phoebe.
And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]	And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.	What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.	Woah.
In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.	[to guys wering yellow isolation suits] So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
I hate actors.	[to an extra in fatigues] Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.
Excuse me.	Ahhhh.
Uh, is your name Chandler?	Uh, yes, yes it is.
Chandler Bing?	Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.	Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.	Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
DAMME: You can tell her I think her friend is cute.	No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.
OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?	OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
Oh that's me, I gotta go.	Oh uh, o, OK.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.	Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.	No one was around to hear that?
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.	Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
Stick a fork what?	Like, when you're cooking a steak.
Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.	Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.	OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.	I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'
What did you say?	Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.	Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?	Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.	You want me to wear your panties?
Could ya?	Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
How you doin there squirmy?	I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?	Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
I want you right here, right now.	Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa [Susie grabs him under the table] They do have the shrimp.
Meet me in the bathroom. [she leaves for the bathroom]	I'm going to the bathroom now. [leaves for the bathroom]
C'mon.	I can't believe we're doing this.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.	Alrighty. [we see Chandler's pants drop from under the stall door]
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?	What?
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.	Oh.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.	OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
C'mon hurry, hurry.	Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.	OK.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.	Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
This is for the fourth grade.	Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.	What, what's what you mean?
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.	That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. [she leaves with his clothes]	Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves [pulls Rachel's gloves out of her purse]	Joey?
Ma?	Joey!
Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.	Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
Are you naked in there?	Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?	No, no, this is the first time.
Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.	I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.
Well, let me see.	No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
What? Let me see. [climbs up in the other adjoining stall]	No, no, you don't have to see.
Hi Tushie.	Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.	How can you not be wearing any underwear?
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.	Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.	Hi.
Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.	Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?	How long you been waitin' to say that?
Hey.	Hey. Hold on a second. [shoots a goal] Huh?
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.	What's this?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.	Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.	Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]	Wow, I don't know what to say. [opens the box and pulls out an incredibly gaudy gold bracelet] Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Heh, what d'ya say?	I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.	[reads] To my best bud. [puts it back in the case] Thanks best bud.
Put it on.	Oh, now? [puts it in his desk drawer] No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. [sets a chair in front of the drawer]
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that br	I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?	Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?	Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
Because she's your lobster.	Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .	Hey, you feelin' better?
Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.	Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]
What is that sparkly thing?	That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
Do you want a refill?	No, I'm alright, thanks.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot	[walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
I'm Gail.	Chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]
I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.	What? [realizes it was the bracelet] Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from th
It's not that bad.	Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
Chandler, Chandler.	I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joe
Oh.	Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? [Joey doesn't respond] Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say?
If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.	Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?	OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I w
You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]	I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . [Joey returns to his room]
Anything larger back there?	I can't believe it.
Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.	Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]
Hey now you have two. [Chandler looks annoyed] Oh, now you have two.	What am I gonna do, huh? [Joey walks in behind him]
Hey.	Hey.
How come you have two?	Well this one's for you.
Get out.	No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [readi
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.	That's what they'll call us.
Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.	Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.
They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.	OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut.
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.	Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.	Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
this summer?	Work on your music?
OK, you guys, ya know, I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.	No, no, no.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.	Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen TV]	Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.	Congratulations!
Uh-huh.	So uh, which one is mine?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. [Chandler starts to sit in one of the chairs] Not that one.	[sits down] Ohh yes.
[sits down] Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.	[reaches for the footrest lever] Do we dare?
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.	Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
This screen is amazing, I mean Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.	Woah!
Hi you guys.	Hey.
Hey you. [they stand together in front of the TV.]	and JOEY: Woah, hey, yo. [Rachel and Ross move]
Bye guys.	Bye.
[walks up to Rachel in front of the TV] Tonight?	and JOEY: Hey, yo. [they move from out of in front of the TV]
BURKE: [bobbing his head] I'll survive.	Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the 
What if we have to pee?	I'll cancel the sodas.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.	You got a Cheeto on your face man.[Joey removes the Cheeto and eats it]
Hi.	and JOEY: Hey.
That was 14 hours ago.	So how'd it go?
Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?	Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?	It's the Miracle Wax.
Hi you guys.	and JOEY: Hey.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .	Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
What's this.	Could you get us a couple of beers?
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.	and JOEY: Hey, woah, hey, woah.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.	She's one of us now.
Hey.	JOEY, and PHOEBE: Hey.
Well we just wanted to stop by and uh, say goodnight.	JOEY, and PHOEBE: Goodnight.
[on the phone] Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect.	Well maybe he was nervous.
Is that the fire alarm?	Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?	That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?	Waaa-aaah.
What?	The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Yeah, so.	Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?
Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.	Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?	Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
TITLES	Hey.
I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.	Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.	Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.	Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
Can you believe this place?	I know, this is a great apartment.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.	Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.	[being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.	Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.	Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.	What?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.	Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.	Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.	Well then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe I will.	Fine with me.
Hey.	Hey.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .	Yeah me too.
I know. Yeah.	Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
No, we're alright.	So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons]
Plastic spoons. Great.	Lick away my man.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.	What?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.	No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.	Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.	Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.	Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?	I did pay for half of it.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.	Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.	Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.	Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores]
Yes! And the table is mine.	Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?	Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.	[quietly] Yeah, I remember.
Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.	So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.	Thanks.
So, I guess this is it.	Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.	Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.	Yeah.
Get out.	No.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.	Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.	OK.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.	[congradulating her and celebrating]
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.	[celebrating more]
I'm done now.	[celebrating]
[sarcastically] I've never wanted you more.	So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? [squeezes the ear of one of the slippers and it barks] Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy.
Hello.	Hey.
Hey!	Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.	Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'	Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, well great.	Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Well OK then. [oven timer goes off behind Chandler] Was that the oven timer?	That's right my friend. It's time for...
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?	I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.	Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'	See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.	But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.	But...
Hey.	So uhh, how's the palace?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?	Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?	Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie.
Wow.	Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.
Oh, now it's a spare room?	Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare.
Well I uh, got what I came for. [puts on moose hat] I'll uh, I'll see you guys.	Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
Hey.	Hey.
Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.	[cheer]
Eddie.	Morning.
Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?	Oh it's uh, over there on the table.
You don't keep it over here on this table any more?	No, Eddie likes to keep it over there.
Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?	Oh, ooh.
Huh.	What?
No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.	Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good.
Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals.	See ya. [Eddie leaves]
So how you two gettin' along?	Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty] Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pa	There's another carton right over there.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.	Alright, so what's it about?
Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?	Well I like both eggs equally.
Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.	Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?
Hey.	Hey.
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.	No.
Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know	Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?
No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.	[stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.
Y-, y-, you like that show?	You don't like that show?
Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.	Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.	Oh o-, OK man.
[singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.	Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Chandler.	[reluctantly sings] You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's reall	God that is good TV.
TITLES	Phoebs, play with meeee.
No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.	Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Why don't you play with your roommate?	Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?	No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?	We don't need to remedy that.
Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.	That was so lame.
I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]	So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?	What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...	Well it's not Sean Penn.
Hi.	Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.	Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Thanks.	Oh, oh, c'mon in.
I'm Tilly.	Oh.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.	Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
He's kind of intense huh?	Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
[walks around corner] A little what?	Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Bye-bye.	Bye.
Bye-bye.	So, we gettin' a fish?
Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.	Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.	This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
Where's Buddy?	Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.	There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?	Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him her
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...	So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
Why?	Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Why would you kill his fish?	Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
Alright.	Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.	We're worried about you.
Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.	We came over as soon as we saw.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.	It's gonna be ok. You know that?
No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed 	I'm sorry man.
No, that means nothin to me.	Uhhhaahh.
Pecan sandy, just made em.	Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
Uh, sure, why not.	[throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking] Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.	[looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker] Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
What's you point man?	Ok, good night. [walks towards his room] You big freak of nature.
	Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.	Why?
Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.	I can't sleep now.
You want me to sing?	No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.
Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.	Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and	I didn't realize that.
Yeah.	GET OUT NOW!!
Ok, you really want me out?	Yes please.
Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.	I want you out.
No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.	Where did you hear it from before?
Hey pal.	Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!	Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.	Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!	Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?	Your last roommate's kidney?
I used to be Bryce on All My Children.	Daaahhhh!
Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!	Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.
I wa-	Uuuh.
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.	Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
What?	You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
You, you want, you want me to move out?	Uh-huh.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?	This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. [walks out the door and after a pause comes back in] But if you think for one sec	You want some help.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.	[enters] Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
Are you sure this time?	Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!
So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?	Our next cocktail party?
Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick.	Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it.	Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Uh, yes.	So what happened?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.	Oh sweet Moses.
Is anyone else starting to really like him?	May I help you?
Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?	Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?
It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.	I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a roommate. [Joey turns around in the leather recliner]
Hello.	Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.
No he, he moved out and I moved in.	Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.
Hey no problem.	See ya. [shuts the door] Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?
Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...	Welcome home man. [they hug and jump around]
A little foos?	Absolutely.
What happened to the foosball?	Ah that's a cantelope.
CREDITS	Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?
He paid a lot of money for it.	I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?
Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.	So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog.
Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.	Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.	Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is t
Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.	Ok, that's Eric.
C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.	I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, you
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?	Ok, this could be tough.
[Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.	Ooh, you almost had it.
Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed h	Hey.
So'd you guys have fun?	Your boyfriend is so cool.
Really?	Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our 	You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].
No problem. Hey Chandler	I think they get it.
Ok.	There's the man.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.	Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.	Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.	Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.	You hear that? We're the guys.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.	[runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.
There's a game?	Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.	Kick save and... denied.
Well, we had a table in college.	Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
[grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?	See, that's why we don't let her play.
Uh-oh.	Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
Oh yeah.	No.
Nooooo.	Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
Uh-huh, yeah.	No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
Nighty-nite.	You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
Not a dad.	I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back]
TITLES	Man, I am so beat.
Oh yeah.	Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?
BULLY: [walks back from the counter] Hey, we were sitting there.	Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?
BULLY: Is that supposed to be funny?	No actually, I was just going for colorful.
Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.	What just happened?
BULLY: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.	That, that is funny. Can I have it back?
BULLY: No.	No?
Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...	Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?
BULLY: You got a problem with that?	No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
What's the matter with you?	The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]	Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.	Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway through it.] Ahhh.	Hey.
What?	Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
BULLY: This couch belongs to us.	Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]	Don't play with his things.
BULLY: The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.	You had to ask.
BULLY: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.	I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
[in the voice] Hard to say.	Your cappucino sir.
Thank you.	Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
How come it's not mixing with the water?	the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
[walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alr	Ok.
No.	No?
No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back do	Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.	Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?	Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?	Ah, there we go.
I think we proved our point.	You burn your mouth?
Cannot feel my tounge.	Bullies, big bullies.
Yes, and that's why we're here.	Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
BULLY: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.	Alright, let's do this.
BULLY: Alright.	Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
Whad'ya mean?	Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.
BULLY: No, you can't use your watch.	Ok. [reaches in his pocket]
BULLY: Or your keys.	Ok.
BULLY: Yeah.	Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.	Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]
Yeah he was wasn't he.	Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
Alright.	Ok so, can I have my hat back?
BULLY: No.	Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls behind the couch]
Look at her.	Hi Monica.
Hey nice boobs.	Guys guys, check this out.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.	Ohhh.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.	Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
Cause she uh, she steals stuff.	Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Agh, it was the graduation from hell.	Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Well, how bout just her mom?	Why her mom?
Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.	Excuse me?
GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?	This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.	So, basically just a Chinese guy.
GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?	Yes because uh, you look so young.
GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?	NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.	Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.	Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Right this is staging.	Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
[as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]	Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler
Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright that's Ross.	Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]
Now I love you even more.	Surprise.
Just go.	Surprise.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?	Well, we could count again.
That's who.	Look, are you gonna be ok?
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.	Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?	It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
What?	Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
Quick volleyball question.	Volleyball.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?	Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
VOICE: Dennis.	Ok, that's me. [runs back]
GREENE: ...what the hell does she want with half a boat...	[running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were 
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.	Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.	Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the	I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.]
I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross in] How are you doing?	Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
GREENE:Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.	Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.	Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Oh, I ordered mine first.	Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Give it to me.	No.
Give it to me.	Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]
[She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.	That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]
Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.	Oh no.
Had it.	Had it.
Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.	Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
But don't you need experience for a job like that?	It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
[enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.	Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.	I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Hey.	Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.	Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.	Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?	Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.	Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.	Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.	Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
What a phony.	Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
DOUGLAS: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?	Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?	It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
DOUGLAS: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.	Uh, if you say so sir.
Joseph's good, isn't he?	Well, I'm going to kill you.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.	Why?
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.	Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.	Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.	Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.	I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.	Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.	Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.	Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her pant
Really?	No freakshow, she's fictional.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.	Thank you.
Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.	Who?
All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.	Wow!
Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.	'Cause he was just so darn cute.
CREDITS	Hey, what did your agent say?
Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)	And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?	I may have.
What's she look like?	Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Woo-hoo, geeek!	I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
Please!	Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
Wow! What's that like?	It's like this, me, no jokes.
Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.	Bye, Richard.
Could not be more terrified.	Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. (Chandler ignores him) Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.	Joey, no means no!
Hey!	I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him (runs out)	Bye.
So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that (points at the computer screen).	Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim (sp?, I'm not an art guy) museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words.
What does she mean by HH?	(shyly) It means we're holding hands.
Are you the cutest?	I'm afraid I might just be.
You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.	Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.	How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'	All right. (reading her answer) My husband is sleeping with his secretary. She's married!
Well at least we know she's a woman.	I can't believe she's married.
Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?	What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Oh, my.	What?
She wants to meet you in person.	Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, w	Okay, I'll do it!
MAN: (standing up) Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. (clears throat, and starts reading his toast) I remember when Barry got home from his first date wit	What?!
I guess we just keep dancing.	Where is she, Where is she? (grabs Rachel) Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?
Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.	(noticing a beautiful blond walking in) Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...	Oh my God! (it's Janice)
OH.....MY.....GAWD!! (Chandler rushes over and kisses her)	OH.....MY.....GOD!!
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.	Did not, she did not wink at you...(sees that their sacred couch is occupied by strangers).
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.	Huh. (They all leave, dejected)
Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would	Morning.
Morning, hey, you made pancakes?	Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
(sarcastically) Good morning.	Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.	I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
(laughs) I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.	Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.	Nope, not this time.
Come on, quite yankin' me.	I'm not yanking you.
This is Janice.	Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.	(looks him in the eye) I'm not breaking up with her! (they stare at each other for a while, then Joey blows in his face)
Rach, look! (she holds two buns up to her ears to make her hair look like the Princess Leia 'do.) Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. (Ross stands up horrified) There he is.	Hey!
Wheel!	Of!
Fortune! This guy is so stupid. (yelling) It's Count Rushmore!!	You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?	No, Janice.
Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.	You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. (walks into the kitchen, Chandler follows closely, he turns around and gets startled). Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair (holds his	Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.	Well, there you go.
Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?	Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! (Joey stares at him) Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Look, what do you want me to say?	I want you to say that you like her!
I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna (grimaces and tenses up) pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.	Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?	Umm, yeah.
No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....	Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?	We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
Nooo!	Yeah, okay.
Yeah?	Yeah! All right! You go first.
Okay, okay, I'll go first.	Okay.
So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....	Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
Yes!	I know!
Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.	Okay.
Okay.	Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
Hmph.	And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!	I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't
Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?	You said...
Hey!	What are you guys doing together?
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! (laughs)	Really.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. (laughs)	You still can't stand her can you?
I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.	Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.	Well, I guess that's something.
No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.	Okay.
Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.	Oh God!
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.	Really?
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. (takes a glass from the fridge.)	Taste it.
(drinks from the glass and puts it back in the fridge) Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!	Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
(entering) Hey!	Hey, mister tux!
Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.	and Joey: Okay. (they don't move)
Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.	(entering from bathroom, with an issue of Cosmo) All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. (to Joey) Get up.
What?	You're in my seat.
How is this your seat?	'Cause I was sitting there.
But then you left.	Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.	The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..	All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. (yells at Joey) GET UP!!
(entering) Hi.	Hey.
Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.	Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
All right! You can have the chair.	Really!
What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?	Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. (Rachel starts to follow Monica into her room, but Ross stops her and sends her back to her room.) There we go, there we go.	You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. (holds his hand a couple of inches in front of Joey's face) Op, not touchi
Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!	and Joey: Sorry Phoebe.
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.	Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
Guys: Noo! (Monica starts to go back into her room and stops) NO!	All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. (sits on Joey's lap) I'm soooo, comfortable.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.	All right! (jumps up)
Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.	All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! (leaves)
I called him.	Nooo.
Well, who's voice was that?	Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.	All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, Get out of my chair, dillhole!
Okay. (he gets up and takes the cushions with him, as he starts to leave)	What are you doing?
You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.	The cushions are the essence of the chair!
That's right! I'm taking the essence.	Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.	We used them as pillows when we went camping.
What?	(shyly) The sheep.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?	He took my essence!
It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.	Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.	What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey, opposite, is opposite! (leaves)	He's got nothing!
Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'	What are you supporting?
It was, it was her voice.	Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
(on phone) Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. (listens) Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's tha	(to Phoebe) You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
Okay, fine. (runs to her room)	They got a phone in there, right?
(yelling from the bedroom) Get away from that! No! (she comes into the living room carrying the phone) She's just getting dressed.	Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.	Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...	Oooo-ooh!
Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!	Jeez, what a baby.
(to Joey) How 'bout instead you, go get changed! (to Chandler) You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!	Stop it. Stop it!
(sits down) Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.	Excuse me. Hi.
Yes?	Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
What do you mean, your seat?	I mean, I was sitting there.
But, you got up!	But, I never left the room!
But, you left the chair area.	All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
(from bedroom) WHOAA!!	(going to the bedroom) See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Hey.	Hey.
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.	Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?	Because the kids need new shoes.
Hey.	Do I look fat?
and Rachel: Noo.	Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.	Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
And it works both ways.	Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. 	That's easy, baggage claim.
(buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.	Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, 
Good luck Chandler.	Thank you Rachel.
(blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.	Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...	Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)
I'm gonna use the cushion.	Yeah.
Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then yo	Okay, the old hug and roll.
Yep.	Okay, one question.
Shoot.	You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
(entering) Hi!	Hey, Phoebe.
Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why	Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
(entering) Hey guys.	Hey Mon.
Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!	Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)
I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.	Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.	That, that's what's stupid.
Night-night Bing-a-ling.	Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', 
Oh, okay. (he kisses her)	No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
(entering from her bedroom) Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2, 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.	You mean there's more than one of us.
Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?	And that's how you bought it?
(entering) Hellooo!	Hey.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?	Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
(sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?	Sure. What's up?
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.	Shhhh!
(to Chandler) Are you intrigued?	You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Credits	Well, it's official there are no good movies.
Hey.	Hey, man. What's up?
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!	Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
(on phone) 'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. A	Is anybody else scared?
(on phone) 'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' (to Monica) I need a pen. (Chandler hands her one	Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
I'm sorry, it just felt nice.	(entering with his ringing phone) Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.	Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. (phone stops ringing) Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?	Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?	Noo.
You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.	No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?	I know, that, (looks at her fake chest, and loses his train of thought, temporarily) that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Hey, you know about that?!	Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
(to Joey) Where there is no fear of commitment.	Do we have any...(turns around and bumps Monica's fake chest) Do we have any thoughts here?
Amazingly, that makes sense.	You think?
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?	'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this. (hands her a present)
Ohhh, are you a puppy! (opens it) Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.	Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. (gives her a drawer) See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.	Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.	Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
We should?	Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
(laughs) I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?	I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be o
You probably want us to move in together?	It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't 	Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! (Janice leaves, Chandler then calls Janice to leave a message on her machine) Hey, Ja
Honey, this will help. (hands him a tub of ice cream)	So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
That is never good.	Then I got all needy and clingy.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?	She said she'd call me.
and Monica: Ohh! (both grab there stomachs in pain)	Oh God.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.	This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Yeah, you do.	So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.	Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.	So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.	I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
(to butcher) No, thank you. (Chandler makes a sound and she notices him) Chandler!	(in a British accent) Hello, Janice.
What are you doing here?	(in accent) Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Are you being British?!	(normal voice) No. Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?	Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party. (grabs a bag off of the shelf)
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?	Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?	Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?	A woman's
What woman?!	(shyly) Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing so	Can I be that guy?
(in a really, really bad Italian accent) That's-ah what I suspected-ah.	....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.
My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.	I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
You know what, everything's gonna be okay.	(answering phone) Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. (to Monica and Rachel) Okay, what do I do?
Yeah.	Hello!
Yes, and grumpy.	What are you, stop naming dwarves! (on phone) Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got.
He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.	(on phone) I love you too.
	(entering) Hey!
Hey!	Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.	Yeah!
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.	Youre building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.	Okay. (notices that Joey is wearing some really tight jeans) My word! Those are snug.
Well, actually Gunther sent me. Youre not allowed to have cups out here, its a thing. (takes her cup and goes back inside)	Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.	All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
Her what?	Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad.
So, Chandler, whos on your list?	Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
Now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your league?	I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Hardy Boy.	Peter Parker.
Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, Ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories....	(coughing) What a geek!
(entering) Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.	Oh, hi.
Chandler.	Hi.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?	We dont, really.
Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.	You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya?	No, you didnt get me!! Its an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?	I do NOT want this unit!!
Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader. Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas.	Fine! (goes into his room and slams the door, then he slams the bottom half of the door.)
Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.	All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....	Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.	Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.	Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
So?	So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
Which you just gave up really quickly.	(entering) Have you seen Joey?
Whats the matter?	Oh, just this! (turns around and has a paint lid stuck to the back of his pants.) Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
(yelling from bathroom) Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.	Whats going on?
Hes retiling my floor. (they both run to the bathroom)	Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.	He started mine first!
Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was. (Chandler tries to go to the bathroom) Whoa! Are you going in there for?	What, like a number?
(entering) Hey!	Hi! Bye! (runs to the bathroom)
Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be.	Okay, on three. One....Two....
Why dont we just go on two.	Why two?
Because its faster.	Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this two talk.
Heavy thing, not getting lighter!	Okay, one...two...
So we are going on two?	All right!! (they lift it into place, however there is one small problem, the unit is so long that it blocks some of both of their bedroom doors.)
So we are going on two?	Oh, good job Joe.
Wow, its big!	Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
Look its not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.	Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours? (throws his shoulder into the center to try and move it, but it doesnt move.)
Y'know what?	Umm?
I bet ya ya I could fit in there. (points to a hole in the center)	Ive got five bucks says you cant.
Get out your checkbook, mister.	Oh, I think I have the cash.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!	Yeah, you got me. (picks up a 2x4 and puts it through the handles so that the doors wont open) Im out five big ones! (puts the money in the crack between the door and frame) Here you go.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.	(entering, with a goatee) Hey.
Hey.	Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.
Why, nobody good?	Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice t
So how many more do you have tomorrow?	Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.

Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.	Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star. (Chandler breaks his penc	Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good. (Eric offers to shake hands) All right. (Chandler hugs him.)

(in triumph) I got a touchdown! We did it!!	Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so youre five feet short, so we win!
Let go! Im a tiny little woman!!	Guys! Guys! Come on! Its Thanksgiving, its not important who wins or loses. The important thing is, (to Joey) the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good 
Isnt there a national football league.	Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights.
	(reading the comics) Eh..., I dont, I dont know.
What?	Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
(to Chandler) Eh, do you believe that?	(thinks about it) Yeah?
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.	Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.	I was shrieking... like a Marine.
I know. I feel horrible. Okay.	(reading the paper) Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. (to Ross) Where exactly were around ten-ish?
All right, see you guys. (starts to leave)	Look out kids, hes coming! (Ross continues to leave with his head down in shame.)
Really?	Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see New York.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?	Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that.	How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
The fear?	Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean why dont you quit and get the fear?	Because, Im too afraid.
I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here.	Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Gunther, I quit.	(to Joey) Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)
....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?	I spelled out boobies.
(covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)	So, how many have you sold so far?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!	Oh my God, how did you do that?
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?	Me! On my computer.
Well you sure used a large font.	Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Hey-hey-hey thats funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!	Something else I might have said?
No, its not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I dont have a lead. Okay, y'know what, Im just gonna, Im just gonna call Gunther and Im gonna tell him, Im not quitting.	You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear.
(entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!	Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)
Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.	Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.	(to Rachel, whos entering) Hey! Howd the interview go?
This is the worst Christmas ever.	Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
That word was swans.	Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
You saved them! You guys! Oh God, youre the best!	Its like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
(answering the phone) Hello? (listens) Yeah, this is she. (listens) Oh! Youre kidding! Youre kidding! (listens) Oh thank you! I love you!	Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
(hanging up the phone) I got the job!	Thats great! Hey! Excellent!
Here we go. Im serving my last cup of coffee. (the gang starts humming the graduation theme) There you go. (hands it to Chandler) Enjoy. (they all cheer)	(to Ross) Should I tell her I ordered tea?
(simulating an echo) Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... (Chandler hits him in the back of the head) Okay, Blast off!	Im an alien. Im an alien.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, Ill show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didnt see was, I looked at it so fast that it was inv	Oh, I got it.
Credits	(entering) Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Honey, whats the matter?	I just saw Janice.
Honey, whats the matter?	Oh.
Honey, whats the matter?	Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them.
Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.	Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Hey Chandler, theres a party tomorrow, youll feel better then.	Oh, y'know what, Im gonna be okay, you dont have to throw a party for me.
Its Joeys birthday.	Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.

Yeah.	Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Yeah.	Woooo hoooo!!!
Yeah.	Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.
Why, what happened?	Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, thats not the worst part.
What is the worse part?	I cant remember which sister.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead.	Okay! You dont think I thought of that?
No, no, no, thats Dina.	(to Monica) You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!!
We didnt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!	Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
That was me.	Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and Im sorry.
Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)	Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister.	Its gotta be the first one.
Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree.	Yep, Im in a tree.
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hells a matter with you? How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you 	Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the do	What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?	(shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?	Im here to see Mary-Angela.
You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was lik	Wheres Mary-Angela?
(shyly) You grow up.	This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
Grandmother: No! I did!	Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
Grandmother: Of course! Its her favorite.	So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite?
Grandmother: More of Grandmas teramisu.	Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is great. Its top notch.
Grandmother: That dies with me.	So will I.
Sister: Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.	Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything.
Sister: (whispering in his ear) Just do it.	Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)
Sister: (whispering in his ear) Just do it.	(startled) Hey!
Sister: Finally, I thought wed never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)	Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
Sister: So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.	Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela.
Sister: No, Im Mary-Theresa.	This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
(standing behind Chandler) I am!	Oh, this is soo bad. (doesnt see Mary-Angela)
Joey!!!	No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey!
Whats goin on?	(pats him on the shoulder) Youre it! Now run and hide!
What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?	I wasnt sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joeys sisters gasp) Look, Im sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
Sister: I say, punch him Joey.	Yeah! Punch him!!
Sister: I say, punch him Joey.	Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brothers not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?
Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought youd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!	Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youre my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again
So what. I say, punch him.	Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
No you wont. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, hes sorry. But, (to Chandler) youve got one more apology to make, all right, youve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.	Okay, absolutely!
All right.	Youve got it. (he starts to look at his sisters, but he still doesnt know which one is Mary-Angela.)
Cookie, now you can punch him!	What?! (Cookie punches him)
Thanks you guys! Thank you.	Dont worry.
(running in from her bedroom, wearing only a towel) Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?	Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
(to Chandler) It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!	All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Why?	I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.	Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
(entering, with about 20 purses hanging around her neck) Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!	(to Phoebe) It must take you forever to find your keys.
Oh.	(to Ross) Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?	Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?	Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, (to Joey) he's really good looking. (Joey gives an enthusiast	Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! (pause) Don't cry outloud.
(hanging up the phone) Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?	I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
Who?	I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
The what?	The abridgment.
Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.	....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
Yeah, I can dance, y'know. (starts to dance really, really, really badly)	Oh no, no, no, no.
Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.	All right, I have to get that, but no-no. (answering phone) Hello? (listens) (happily) Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. (listens) Let me ask you this, w
Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.	Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
(reading) The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...	To yourself. (finishing) Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.	Bye-bye.
Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!	What, what, what?!
What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, (reading) 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty	You really think that is what he meant?
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?	Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
What am I going to do?	Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I don't know you guys.	All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, bec
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, (sadly) 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 	He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?	Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. (holds up a pen) See, she's fully dressed, right?
Right.	And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and (clicks pen) w
Hello.	Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.	Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
You have a play date with a stripper?!	Man, I gotta get a kid. (looks at the pen and starts laughing)
(to Chandler) Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.	Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.	Yeah, baby!
What are you doing?	Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
(entering, holding a pair of Roller Blades) Hi.	Hey.
(entering from her bedroom) Morning.	Hey.
Monica, what are you doing?	Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now shes celebrating that by going on a date with him.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.	Oh, hey.
Oh.	(to Robert) So ah, isnt a bit cold out for shorts?
Well, Im from California.	Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.
Well, Im from California.	(standing up) Im up! Im up, Ive gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything?

What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay?	No. He.....hes coming out of his shorts.
What?!	The man is showing brain.
No, no, that wont be ah, that wont be necessary (leans down and looks up Roberts shorts, seeing Roberts package.)	(to Ross) Wellll?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!	What do we do? What do we do?
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.	Like an eclipse.
These little women. Wow!	Your liking it, huh?
But Jos got a crush on Laurie. (Ross nods his head) Oh. You mean its like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.	No, actually Lauries a boy.
Hey!	Hey.
Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.	You mean a three pointer?
You guys!! Come on!	Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isnt as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Oh! Wow! Hey!	Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
All right Ill talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?	Hmmm, thats very cool.
Joey! I cant believe you just did that!	I cant believe she cracked your code!
Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?	No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel?
Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it on the lose? Is it watching me?	We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
(to Chandler) Hey, dont we have to...	Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.	I like her.
(to Chandler) Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?	Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people.
I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....	(to Ross) All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. Id like know whether thats several big fish or just one big fish.
(to Chandler) Someone in there?	No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.
(to Chandler) Someone in there?	Jeez, man did you fall..(sees its a beautiful woman coming out of the mens room) Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.	(to Gunther) Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, (tries to get her to say her name). (to her) This is the part where you say your name.
Ginger.	Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....
Dont you have to use the bathroom?	Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you. (pause) Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom. (knocks on the door)
I ran!!	Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive ever met in a mens room.
Actually, me too.	(sees her foot is in a slush puddle) Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.
Oh damn, I hate that.	Yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
Oh, dont worry about it.	No, really youre gonna freeze.
No, Im not.	Youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?
(entering) Hi!	Hey.

So umm, how was your date with Ginger?	Great. It was great. Shes ah, shes great, great looking, great personality, shes greatness.
Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package.	Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Uh-huh.	Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it did. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the sm
(entering from his bedroom) Morning.	(to Monica) Actually hes the smallest person in the world.
(to Chandler) Heard about the leg burnin huh?	It came up.
Your thinking about my leg arent you?	No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
Its okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: How much it bothers you? because I dont like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?	No. No. I dont think so.
Whats that?	Thats-thats my nubbin.
Whats a nubbin?	Its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
You have three nipples?	Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... (starts to kiss her again, but she gets up.) Ahh, what?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.	You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?

Where have you been?	The doctor.
Is everything okay?	Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.
Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!	That was an obvious joke, and I didnt think of it. Why didnt I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!
Its a globe and, a pencil sharpener.	(entering) Hey, does anybody need anything copied? Im going down to the Xerox place.
Oh, no thanks.	Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?	Yeah! You wanna come?
Credits	Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
(to Chandler and Joey) Can I help you?	Uh-oh.

Hi guys. I havent seen you since this morning.	Well ah, ........y'know.
Great. Ill ah, see ya then.	All right, rock on. (Does the Hang 10 sign, then hides his face in shame.)
Hey, dont call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!	Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?
Uh, 10:30.	What time is it now?
4:30.	Yeah all right, so well hang out.
Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?	Yes. Vividly.
She was kidding about that right?	Yeah, I-I-I think so. (Pauses and thinks about it for a second) Yeah, I-I think so...
God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?	Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?
Dude, I dont know.	She was kidding.
Yeah.	She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing.	Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there.... (holds his arm out and pretends to grab something with his hand.)
Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... (clears throat) y'know each would, (clears throat again) y'know (pause) be?	Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails?	Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this with you.
I want you to met some friends of mine. (Introduces him to Chandler and Joey) This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we dont do that, and he says you gotta	And thats the only colour that comes in.
Oh! (storms off)	So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.	Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?	Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?	Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.	Why? What happened to him?
They have the best stuff in there.	Oh my God! Oh my God!
You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?	Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.	Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her.
Yeah, but dont you think....	All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for.
Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail.	Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacs sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it!
We were just waxing our legs.	Off?!!
For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.	Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joeys arm and puts a strip on it.)	Oh, thats mature.
What?	Nothing, nothing.
Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.	Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?!	(to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Okay! All right! How was she?	Uh-oh.
Awful! Horrible!	She was not good. Not good.
Ewwwww!	Uh-oh.
Should we do something?	Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Oh, that is so sweet. I think Im falling in love with you all over again.	Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.	(handing Monica the wax) Wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever.
(covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because its, I mean its you.	Ohhhhh!
We could eat the wax! Its organic.	Oh great, food with hair on it.
No, not the used wax.	Because that would be crazy?
Theyre gonna get through this, arent they?	Yeah, come on, its Ross and Rachel, theyve got too.
You think I need a new walk?	What?
Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a take notice walk.	Are you actually saying these words?
Maybe she killed him?	Lets go.
Maybe she killed him?	(to Joey) Is that your new walk?
Can I see the comics?	This is the New York Times.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?	We are. Hes meeting us here.
Well Ross was hangin out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....	Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for maki	Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
Oh, I had the opposite dream.	Y'know what maybe its gonna be okay, I mean its been a week.
(softly) Is he here?	No.
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (theyre all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out lou	Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Hm-mm.	Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Chandler!!	(jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!
Youre smoking again?!	Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, Im, Im smoking still.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?	Look, Im telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Werent you nine?!	Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Werent you nine?!	Oh thats great, with my luck, thats gonna be him.
Him? Him, Ross?	Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and its Rachel again.)
Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? Im asking you first, right?!. I mean Im 	Absolutely, yeah!
Chandler! Youre smoking? What are you doing?!	Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!!
Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks.	Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Pity food? Y'know what thats okay, all right, I dont need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays.	Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Why? Do you think hes still mad at us?	(to Joey) Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Chandler!!	What?
What does the sign say?	Beam me up Jesus.
No, the No Smoking sign. Theres no smoking in my Grandmothers cab.	Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
No, the No Smoking sign. Theres no smoking in my Grandmothers cab.	Oh!
No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.	Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.
Oh, now I have to go!!	Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.
No, y'know what dont close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking themselves out.) cause the... keys...are in there.	Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Whats going on?	(to Joey) My lighters in there! (points to the cab)
Break	Damn! (stands up) The tailpipes not hot enough to light this!
Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?	Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
No, I stuff outside the bra.	Ladies, ladies, lets just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monicas bra.
(seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.	Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.	Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass.
(opening the door) And there you go!	Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Chandler!!	At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.	I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another cigarette.)
Then why are you smoking?	Well its very unsettling.
Oh, its Ross on one of his drives!	and Joey: Hey!!
He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course Im stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, Ive got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.	No! Come on!
Arrrghh!!	Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense!
(to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and were then gonna go skiing?	Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible.
Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?	Phoebe, and Joey: No, I wasnt gonna ask you that, no.
Excuse me?	Its horrible.
I-I cant handle this, you guys.	Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actually its the ah, middle part of my first name.
(to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.	Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to stop the fighting.)
Okay!	I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
(to Chandler) Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here.	Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.	Okay.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler back the cigarette.)	No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.
Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit. (hands Chandler back the cigarette.)	Okay, thats like the least fun game ever.
Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit. (hands him an audio cassette)	Oh. (takes the cassette and puts it on his arm like the stop smoking patch, and it falls off.) Nope, that patch is no good. (Joey and Monica both do their fake laughs.)
All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.	Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Oh, yeah!	Wow!
Yeah, I do, yeah.	Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one of us to get married.
Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.	Always illegal Joe.
Ohhh. (They embrace in a very passionate kiss.)	If that doesnt keep kids in school, what will?
All right.	(entering, carrying a briefcase) Hi.
Hey.	Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?	Y'know what, pretty good.
Yeah?	Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Here you go.	Thanks
Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.	What check thing?
As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him.	(reading the check) Pete Becker. Pete (quickly grabs a magazine and opens it up to show her a picture) (pointing to the picture) Is this him?
Thats Bill Clinton.	Whos he huggin?
Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete?	This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
We use it!!	There you go!!
Oh yeah, sure, that too.	(to the girls who are staring at him) What?
Okay, thats great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.	Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Oh my God! The millionaires here!	(in a feminine way) Oh my God! (and he jumps all around)
Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?	Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
I know!!	Okay, then get the lobster!
And thats why, Im not inviting you in for a drink. (starts to leave) Bye.	Oh-no-no-no-no.
Hello, people who do not live here.	Hi! Hello!
Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?	Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately.
Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.	Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Two.	Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
and Phoebe: Oh.	Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
(entering) Hello.	and Joey: Hey!
Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.	Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if I broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.
Then be supportive like a guy.	(in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, Id miss you.
So, youre like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)	And youre our age. Youre our age.
Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.	Thats not a state Joe.
I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later.	Okay.
I got to go, so ah, Ill see you guys later.	Youre our age!
It does in mine!	I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. D
You bug me.	Is there any chance you didnt see that?
Break	Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, shed say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!	You didnt just break up.
Hey, its been like three weeks!	You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this. (turns away, then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date ov	Okay.
Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!!	And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!	Stop what?!
I dont know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. Ill go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!	No!! You cant!!
Look, they must be stopped!	I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!
I need juice! People need juice!!	Look man!
People need juice!	Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the door shut with his feet.)
Juice, I need...	Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is o
Yeah, okay.	Okay.
Its just I miss her so much.	I know. (He rubs Rosss head)
(to Monica) One second.	I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. (He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a gunfighter in a Western.)
(to Monica) One second.	(to Joey) I wasnt doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks shes like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!	Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.
God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so good.	I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?	Im talking about you. You big, big freak.
Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind.	Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!
(to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isnt it Spiderman? Yknow like Goldman, Silverman...	Cause its-its not his last name.
It isnt?	No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man.
Credits	So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
Okay well, he would turn things to gold.	What about things that are already gold?
Ahh, his work is done.	Okay, lets play my game now.
	Wait a minute, wait. Youre telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnt want you back?!
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.	My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Hey, Rach!	Hey.
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnt have to walk me all the way back up here.	Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem. (He starts to look around her office.)
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we dont keep the womens lingerie here in the office?	Yes, I realise that.
Summer catalogue! (hands him the catalogue)	Thats the stuff! (quickly grabs it)
Bing! Thats a great name.	Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done. So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
(entering) Hey!	Hello.
Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.	(holding a tissue) And is this in case the house sneezes?
(entering) Hey!	Hello.
I-I know. Well if something comes up... (walks away)	Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...	Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin out the Chan-Chan man!
(looks at him) That was (pause) surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?	Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it.
Hey!	Hey!
and Rachel: Ahhhh!!	(entering) Hey, my Fathers house does that!
(to Chandler) O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.	Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Hmm.	Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a big, dull dud!
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this. (He closes his eyes and moves th	(entering with Rachel) Im telling ya, Joannas got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime. Ill give you a call.
Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her?	Thats what you say at the end of a date.
You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night?	To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion.
(grabbing the magazine out of his hands) Call her! Call her now!	Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand. Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy!	(sarcastic) Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that you havent called her. You have to call her!	Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you!
Well then youre going to have to take her out again.	Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you	All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
Thats fine!	Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know.
(She pauses to ready herself, and removes the tissue.) Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!	Its not a big deal. Its, just its right here, (points to his eye) and its all the time.
Well, thanks again for lunch.	(He looks over at Rachel, who nods her head) Yes, this, this was pleasant.
It was, wasnt it?	The food there was, was great.
Wasnt it?	So take care.
You too.	Well, this was great. Ill give you a call. We should do it again sometime. (Rachel is disappointed)
(whispering) Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!	Noo!
Chandler!!	Look, Im sorry. Okay? Im weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
Okay, you are going to tell her and youre going to tell her now. (She grabs his nipple and starts to twist it.)	AhhhhIm not going to call you.
What?	Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnt Rachels fault. Its me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to w
Well, this isnt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.	Yeah, o-okay.
So...	Well this is great! Ill give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Credits	(sporting a goatee) Hey.
Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.	Oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me. (theres no reaction from Joey) Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sittin
(entering) Hey!	Hey.

Yeah! Theyre putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channels gonna film it!	Oh my God! Whos gonna watch that?!
Thanks. You ready to go?	Yeah. (they start to leave)
Saw a girl with that vest.	Thanks. (He takes off the vest and throws it on the floor.)
Okay, good bye! (leaves)	So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Umm, oh, about three months.	Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
(entering carrying a box) Hey!!	Hey!
I got you something! Open it! Open it!	Okay. (He opens it and its a baby chick) Its a chicken.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?	Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Oh, well no problem there. (He picks up the chick, hugs it really tight, and talks to it like its a little baby.)	Easy Lenny.
No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.	Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey enters)-chickeeeen.
Hey.	Hey.
Hows she doing?	She?
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?	I dont know. (He picks the chick up and turns it over, trying to determine the sex of the chick, and blows on it.) I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.	Excuse me?
What?	I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Hey! Who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?	You dont think I get up when you get up?
Ohhh, here it comes.	Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I dont think so mister!
Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!	And you dont think taking care of our chick is work?
Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant...	I know what you meant!! (pause) You notice that ever since we got this chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
I dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick.	Ill take her back tomorrow.
(entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!	Hey!
(He checks his watch) Sure. Ill help you.	(rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Oh, just go. Youre never gonna get it!	I know. See, yes. Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
(sees hes watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.	I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
(sees hes watching Baywatch) Ohhh. (sees he still has the chick) Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.	If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.	Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.	Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.	Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Okay.	Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
(to Chandler) Thats a duck.	Thats a bad duck!!! (to Ross) Howd the thing go tonight, Ross?
Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her apartment) Easy.	(to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
(After he closes the door) See ya.	(coming out of his apartment and seeing Ross) What did you do?
What cha doing?	Having a swim.
What about the chick?	Chicks dont swim.
Are you sure?	I dont know. Should we try it?
Sure.	See, I told you they dont swim. (He goes to take it out)
(stopping him) Wait. Give him a minute.	Noo! (takes him out) Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.
No! Rachel, thats what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I dont get through, theyre not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! Its us versus them!	Ye-e-es!!
(entering) Hey.	Hey.
Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?	Phoebe, and Rachel: I had one.

Okay, bye-bye!	Bye!
Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!	Oh!

No.	Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
No, Im good. (He sits down, stunned.)	(seeing Joey) There he is!
So, so, whatd ya think?	Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
I-I wasnt in that.	I know.
Director: (stepping in) Excuse me. Excuse me. (to Kate) Sweetheart! (Kisses her.) Come! (They leave.)	So thats the girl you like.
(drags Chandler over to buffet table) Im telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think hes baaad news!	Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy Rachels dating? Well, thats odd.
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.	Could I borrow it?
(bringing Chandler a cup) This is from the woman at the bar.	Oh-ho-ho-ho.
One.	7:15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesnt work.
No, its not just cause Im jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a Come on look) I mean Im not, Im not, Im not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple s	Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like, (claps his hands) banging his hands together!

Sorry, Im so sorry, I will pay you back.	Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.	Or... Dick.
(entering) Hey.	and Joey: Hey.
Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.	Was it like a sneeze only better?
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)	and Joey: Whoa!!!
Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out. (starts to take off his pants)	No!!
Come on you guys, it's no big deal! (He turns around and shows him his thing.)	Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! (sees it) Huh.

Hi!	Hey!
98 hot saves, highest in the force.	Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
(dead serious) Fire safety is not a joke, son.	You're right, I know.
(going over to him) Well?!	(joining them) Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.	Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two
Pete's breaking up with me.	What?!
(starting to get up) I gotta go water Pete's plants. (stops) Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.	Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.	Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Rhodes: Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.	Whoa. (they all lean in to get a closer look, Ross isn't pleased)
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.	(sitting down on the couch) I-kea! This is comfortable.
I see him, you guys are just the worst hiders ever.	(standing up) Hey Pete.
I love you.	I love you, love you.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.	So, what do you thing the good news is?
Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we dont even know if hes gonna propose.	Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.	Oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh?
Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, its just Jasons so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive its just better than having just like a really, really, really nice (pause) butt. (H	Good luck!
Credits	(comforting the duck) Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
	Do you think that theres a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as youre driving into town theres-theres like a sign, and it says Youre in Sample. (He says it like urine sample.)
(entering) Hey.	Hey!
He didnt ask me to marry him.	Ohh.
And its not fake, its totally brutal.	Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre are no rules.
So thanks for the warm welcome. Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, lets go out there and get em! Huh? And remember, there is no I in team.	Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.

(stunned) Dude, what are you doing?	Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
Yeesh, whatd you do about it?	Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob.	Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em.
Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. (thinking alo	(to Ross and Monica) What if Joey were president?
Bing! (Chandler stands bolt upright and turns around to face him.) Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. (He goes to slap his butt, but Chandler slides over making him miss.) Ooh. Barely got y	(to his co-workers) What is with him?
We never get smacked.	Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once.
(coming out of his office) Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?	No sir.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?	(joining them) Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Okay, well be right in. (to Chandler) So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?	Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
(sticking his head out the window) Fights over!	Excuse me, Doug? (no reaction) Hey there sports fan!!
(turning around) Bing! You got those numbers for me?	No, I ah, I didnt do them.
Oh, you forgot?	No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. (laughs) Thats okay, youre still my number one guy! (slaps him on the butt) Bing!	Doug!!
Hmm.	Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!	No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
Oh?	Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous.
Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! Youre okay.	Okay. (he starts to leave)
Ha! (goes to smack him on the butt, but stops, faking Chandler out) Ahhhhhhh!	Ahhhhh! (walks out, imitating shooting himself in the head)
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up (points to the chart), so Im happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. (They start to leave) Phil! Nice job. (smacks him on the butt) Stevens! Way to go! (smacks 	Thank you, sir.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! (smacks him on the butt) (to Chandler) Well, what about you? Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?	No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?	Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Announcer: Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...	Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Announcer: Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.	Oh! Oh! (they all recoil in horror)
Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didnt want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete cant.	Ohh!! (they all start pointing at the screen)
	(to Bonnie) So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I dont know, we were, we were making out.	Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.
(entering, hurridly) Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! (She hands Chandler a picture) Thats my Moms writing! Look.	(reading the back of the picture) Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
No-no, thats not, thats not me Phoebe, thats her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.	Oh!
I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this we	Yeah! Yeah, we can!
(watching a happy couple walk by, arm in arm) Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.	Youre not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
(sarcastic) Thanks!	Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.
Yeah right.	Why is that so funny?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.	Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! (hits him on the arm)	Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your door, and Im like (in a fake voice) Hey, nice to meet, ya
No, its just my luggage.	Monica, and Joey: Hey!!
(approaching) Hey!	Hey!
Hey-hey, check out the hat!	What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I cant have children!!
Ohh, thank you.	Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.	No, no!
Oh, come on!	Big bullies!!
(entering) Oh, hey!	Hey!
Oh, so, how are we doing?	Bored and bored!
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?	Noo!!
I dont know, but were having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, shes gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I dont know! So, youre all bored?	Ohh!!
I dont know, but were having dinner tomorrow night, so I figured, shes gonna tell me then. Y'know maybe she just wanted to give him time to, buy me presents, I dont know! So, youre all bored?	Yes!
Okay. (Starts to spin) Ooh, y'know we could just do this. (She stops at Chandler)	Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker.
All right, relax. Its just a shoe.	Wooooo!!!!
Break	So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material?
Huh?	I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
You didnt even take off your pants.	Yeah, well, lucky for you.
What?	I dont know.
Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?	Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.
Good morning.	Hey.
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet. (she starts to leave)	Where ya going?
Well, are any of those people here?!	Oh, no!! No, no!
Hey, everybody!	Wow!! (they all recoil in shock and horror)
I feel...	(to Joey) Noo!! I dont care! Im not, Im not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
Thats not true! Her, she doesnt even know what she wants! Rachels still mad about the whole thing.	Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You dont need that kindve hurt. Take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship......
(coming back from her swim) Hey!	Ahhhh! (Steps away from her.)
You guys, the waters great. You should really go in.	Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&amp;M.
Okey-dokey!	There is not one hair on that head.
Credits	(in a fake voice) Hi there.
Thats that weird voice again.	Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youre gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Thats that weird voice again.	Hi! Im Dorf! Youre date for the evening. (Monica walks away in disgust) Oh come on! Dorf on dating, thats good stuff!!
(voice-over) Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...	(to Monica) (in a funny voice) Hi there. (Monica turns her head away in disgust)
(closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! Were out of soda.	(jumping up) Oh, Ill go out and get you some.
Really?!	Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, whos entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.	I found a dried up seashores.
I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)	All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Ennnh.	Ive got canned goods.
(jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!	Excellent hole, Joe.
Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!	Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!
Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!	Weve got to do something!
Dont blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.	Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.
Nothing. Im gonna take a shower.	Me too!!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their 	Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna break up with you!
No?	Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Nope.	(jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
No. Im-Im to depressed to talk.	Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
(coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?	Monica, and Joey: NO!!!
(stopping him) No! Joey, we swore wed never tell!	(running over and joining Monica) Theyll never understand!
(interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk.	(following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnt think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monicas shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action
And I was tired from digging the huge hole!	And then Joey remembered something.
Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnt. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure	(wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
(yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!	(entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?
And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!	I KNEW IT!!!!
(sets down some cards) Gin.	We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Will you stop!	Okay. All right.
	Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.	You dont turn and slide, you throw it out! Im tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Look, were not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!	All right, how about we, how bout we sell it.
All right. But, youre gonna have to tell them. (He opens the cabinet to reveal the chick and the duck living inside with Christmas lights and a disco ball as decorations.)	(nods his head) Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? (to Joey) They seem all right with it!
(reading the newspaper) Hey, heres a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?	Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
Yeah.	(reading the ad) Stunning entertainment center. Fine, (pause) fine Italian craftsmanship. (Joey is very proud of himself)
Why? I love that thing.	You want it?
and Rachel: Oh no.	Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!	All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.	(looks at him) Nooo.
Oh. What do you do?	I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living!
(to Chandler) Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni...	(interrupting) Let it go!!
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think any of them are gonna work out.	Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Pretty nice?	Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.	Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!	All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
(holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that whe	(disappointed) Yeah.
He is right, isnt he?	Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong.
He is right, isnt he?	You think?
He is right, isnt he?	Oh-no, hes right.
Hi!	Hey!
All right!!	Im coming already!!
Yeah, they still wear underwear.	OH MY GOD!!!
(still trapped in the entertainment center) WHAT?!!	Are you all right?!
Yeah...	(lets him out) What happened?!!
(getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!!	What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man!	SoYou got in voluntarily?!
I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do?	BEND OVER?!!!
(entering) Oh my God! What happened?	Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
(entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?	Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop calling us.
Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?	Monica, Joey, and Rachel: Thats a good call. Right.
Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And youre welcome to come back anytime.	Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)	Oh no-no-no, Im, Im paddling away!
(Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!	Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!	Could we be more white trash?
Just pickle.	Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that mustve been awkward.	Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
(laughs) You ah, you didnt say Yes to that did you?	(laughs) No. No!
(Coming out of the shower wearing nothing but a towel) Hello, Rachel. (She goes into Chandlers bedroom)	Well, not at first.
I dont understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud.	Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!	Oh, come on! Its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.	Okay, I promise, Ill end it.
Thank you.	I hope you know what Im giving up for ya, because shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod Yes.)	Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. (Joey starts to nod Yes.)	it was like the Algonquin kids table. (They all laugh, but Joey only laughs not to be left out.)
Op, the ruined quiches are ready.	It just doesntfeel like were breaking up.
No, we are. Im sad.	Okay.
(answering the phone) Yes. (listens) Uh, cant you wait until tomorrow? (listens) All right. (hangs up) Unbelievable!!	Thanks.
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.	Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)
What are you doing?	Im getting dressed.
Why?	When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Wait. I wanna show you something.	What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (Shes holding a pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.	Ah-ha, youre not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.
(kisses him) Ill be back in ten minutes. (Starts to leave)	You are, youre gonna leave me like this?
Knowing youre here, waiting for me I think its kinda exciting.	Okay. But if you dont come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) theres pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Yeah!	Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?
Break	Hello, Joanna(Realises he doesnt know her last name)s office.
(on speaker phone) Im really sorry but I may be a little while longer.	How little?!
A couple of hours, I feel awful.	Look, this isnt funny! You get back here right now!
I cant!!	Why not?!
Im in my bosss car!	What?!
(answering it) (angrily) What?!	(in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
(answering it) (angrily) What?!	Okay, heres the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pa
You promised you would break up with her!	I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!	It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.	No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I cant get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and Im cold, and (Stops a
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!	Never!
You never come into this office again!	Fine!
You give me back my Walkman!	Inever borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!	You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)
Does it hurt?	No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?	About what?
When she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and Im gonna get fired!	Ill make something up! Im good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know that I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)	Oh-ho-ho, I dont think so!
No, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know that I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)	Well, this is much better.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, shes very private about her office. Now I know why.	Hey, look, youre in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, shes gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?	It still wouldnt be clean. (Rachel makes an Eww, disgusting! face) All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month!	Freedom!
Ill take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!	Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)
No! God, would you just calm down!	Im gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.	No!
I ah Oh! Ill squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!	With extra pulp?
(happily) Yeah!!	No!
Doh!! (pause) Ive got it!	You dont have it.
I have so got it. Theres gonna be rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.	How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.	(intrigued) Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generations Milton Berle.	And Milton Berle has a
That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, dont bite your nails.	(hello) Hello.
(in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)	(to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)
No he doesnt!	(checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!
So did you break up with Joanna?	I think so.
Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
With such a sad history.	Could there be more Kims?
Hey! New wallet, huh?	Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnt say cool anymore.
(Picking up a card from Chandlers wallet.) My God! Is this a gym card?	Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
So why dont you quit?	You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to 
Who is Maria?	Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?	No!
So youre strong enough to face her on your own?	Oh no, youll have to come.
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that ones actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.	Why dont you just give him to somebody else?
Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.	Because thats the only part of you he can see when hes on the table!
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.	Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
One more time, Hey, dont you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?	No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Good! Thats good!	Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
Employee: You wanna quit?	I wanna quit the gym.
Employee: You do realize that you wont have access to our new full service Swedish spa.	(He turns to Ross and Ross makes a Be strong sound.) I wanna quit the gym.
Employee: Sorry, members only.	(horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.
Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!	Hey.
Hey! So, did you quit?	No, I almost did, couldnt leave Ross there without a spotter!
Oh, umm, I was just yknow working out and umm Oh, thats it.	Were doomed. Okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?
Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.	Youre a genius!
Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies!	Now, theres two reasons.
(entering) Hey.	Hey!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get too excited, I just ahh, yknow try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!	Thank you, Joey.
Hello.	Hi.
No-no.	No, wed just like to close them.
Lambert: Hi, Im Karen.	I wanna quit the bank!
What are you ever gonna use that for?!	To pay for the gym.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!	Hey.
Treeger:: Hey Duck, is Chick here?	Yeah Bunny-rabbit.
Yeah, whatever. (Walks away)	Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Just go up to her and ask her out. (Chandler laughs) Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?	I could die.
Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.	I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
(entering) Oh.	Hey! (Phoebe sneezes)
(in a nasally voice, from her cold) But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. (She puts her shoe on the table, and it's horribly decorated) Pretty, hu	All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
Just be yourself. But, not too much.	(gets up) (softly) Wish me luck.
(loudly) Good luck!	Wish it! (To the woman, Kathy, he likes) Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.	Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
With a K.	Oh-oh-hey!
Wow! You are really good at this.	Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
Hey!	Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. (Joey kisses Kathy.)
Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?	Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. (Starts to sing) Smelly cat, smelly cat	(sees Kathy is up watching TV) Hi!
Hi.	Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.	Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
You're kidding! Oh, I love him.	Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
Oh please!	So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.	That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
(laughs) Oh-oh-oh-oh!	Is it on?
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!	Hey! (Runs over and gets his wonder broom)
Oh my God!	Oh! It's on! It's on!
Oh my God!	There we go little fella.
(laughs) What about the duck?	Well the duck can swim.
(singing, drunk) My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.	Way to go, Phoebe!
Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.	Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
Y'know what, I like Kathy.	Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
Yeah, she's...	She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
You love her.	No, I don't.
Come on, Pheebs lay off him.	Thank you, Ross.
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.	All right.
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.	Ohh!
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.	All right.
Who wants to make some long distance calls?	Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! (She doesn't hear him and keeps running, Chandler starts chasing her as the theme to The Mod Squad starts to play. First, a car almost hits him and then gets mustard s
Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?	Oh, I just wanted to say, Hey!
Hey!	Okay. (He walks away disgusted with himself.)
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.	(entering) Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!	I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. (he waits for a reaction, when he doesn't get 
(to Chandler) We were just talking about you.	Really?!
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.	(laughs) Right in there!
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.	99...100! Ready or not, here I come! (He opens his eyes and sees that the chick and the duck are still sitting in front of him) All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
Hey guys. (to Chandler) Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?	Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
It's 4:30.	Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Okay, I see what's going on here.	You-you do?
Yeah! You don't like Kathy.	You got me.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?	Yeah. Right.
Good, and hey! My treat. (He turns to go into his bedroom then stops.) But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?	Okay.
(to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?	Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!	Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!	Uhh, no-no thanks.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.	Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)
(to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?	What?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.	Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.	I am pretending.
Well then, do it better!	Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking a
(opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?	Can I sleep on your couch?
Hey what are you guys looking at?	Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?	Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.	Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
Credits	Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?	Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?	Well, I have a call in about that.
'Kay.	Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!	Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?	Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!	It doesn't say that. Does it?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?	Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.	It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.	(confused) Sure...
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?	I don't know... um, Grease?
No....	Rent?
Yes! Rent!	Okay, so when do you want to go?
(entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.	Yes, it is, at Office Max.
What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)	A pen.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?	Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
Why not?	Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!	All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.	For three years?
(whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...	All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?	Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!	Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called Invisible things for Kathy. (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.	She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.	Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
(entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!	Where?
Our place, the hall! I...	I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!
(Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?	No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?	No, it came out to an even twenty.
Hey!	Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.	Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!	[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
Hey!	Hey! Happy birthday.
You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.	No he didn't. [Moving it back.]
Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!	Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to. (Opens the box) Wow.	See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug).	Oh, yeah... yeah.
Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).	[to Kathy] Goodnight.
Um, thank you for the gift.	Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.	Uh, the book?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.	What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese. Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.	(tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, Uhl, ell.
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.	Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well....	Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)
	(entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise.	It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows. Because every time were in the room together there
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?	Yeah! Oh my God!
Great! (leaves)	(rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.	Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.	(shocked) What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)	Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?	Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He cant believe he just sad that.)
What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.	Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?	All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Okay, guys.	All right! Bring it on, you
Here we go. (Plays one note) Yknow, Ive-Ive never played my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Yknow	(interrupting) Oh my God! Play!
(At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific.	Really, bitchin!
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.	You mean like, music?
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.	Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear.	Come in!
(entering) Hey! (sees whats on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?	Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
So is Joey around?	No-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I uh, dont really have a preference. You?	I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.
(on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, its me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.	What happened?
We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as soon as I can.	Why cant you tell her?
Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to(he stops talking suddenly)	Joey! Joey!!
Yeah?	I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more(his time runs out for real)	(to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he says hes sorry.
Oh.	So I guess its just uh, you and me then.
Oh, okay.	Yeah, I think it is!
So what did you do today?	Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut
(interrupting) Oh, it looks great!	and then it got canceled.
Well, I could cut it.	Really?! You do that?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?	Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.	Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Yknow who also has great hair is Joey!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, Im basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.	What-what cha doin?
Checking to see if its even.	Kay.
Looks good.	(jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phones making sounds! (On phone) Hello!
(on phone) Hey dude, its me.	Hey its Joey!
Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnt there!	What?
Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.	Okay.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.	Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)
(on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no its fine, dont worry about it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay. (listens) Yeah! Ill talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably g	Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my purse.	Oh.

Horrible!	Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
No-no-no, the kiss was good.	Okay!
No, but thats bad!	Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened.
What?!	Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy forever. Sound good?
Can you really do that?	I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you	(interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see, youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn.
Im sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.	I-I think we have too.
Okay. Bye.	Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?
Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)	Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)
(rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?	I sure did.
Why?	Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, youre amazing.	Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)
(very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?	Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.	Oh, I dont know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.	You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.	Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.	Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.	Consider Casey.
Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think?	That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!	I kissed Kathy.
Does Joey know?	No. Is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside.	Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is it?
He loves you.	Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!!
I remember you did.	God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!
Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him.	Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Because you do.	Yeah, I know.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.	Hey!
Hey! Samboucha Margarita?	Is that a real thing?
Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.	Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Whats up?	Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
You do?	Yeah.
Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my girlfriend anymore.	What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.	Oh uh, when?
Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why I let people watch.	Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh?	Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too.
No-no-no, no its uh, its okay.	Yeah?
Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first.	Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. So	See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?	Its me. Im the other guy.
What?	Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and
And what?! Did you sleep with her?!	No! No! No! I just kissed her.
What?!! Thats even worse!!	How is that worse?!
I dont know! But its the same!	Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think Im in love with her!
Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!	Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you!	Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like Well, kinda.) Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the 	Probably because
(answering phone) Hello.	(on phone) Hey, its me. I know you cant stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone. All I (Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)
(answering phone) Hello.	Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im (Joey hangs up the phone again.)
Credits	(entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
So are things with you and Joey any better?	They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
I know, but all that work youre doing to get it ready, I just (goes into her bedroom.)	Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, cause I wanna trade for her.
I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!	Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade!	Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it (notices the look on Monica and Phoebes faces.
Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.	Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase.
Who cares? He works in a museum!	Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
You dont have to do that, Ross and Joey arent here, you can watch the parade if you want.	Thanks.
(standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!	Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills.	Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont have a boyfriend!	Hes really picky about his patients.
Okay, get out of my kitchen!	(entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean y
So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.	Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Really?! Wow! Thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me?	I dont know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.	Oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Oh, thats not true! Ive got her lots of stuff she never took back.	Like?
Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.	When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh	Big dog?
Oh my God, is it really that bad?	I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Oh.	Hey Joe.
Timothy Burke: Ready?	Hey! Im sorry! That(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?
My folks.	Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.	What?!
Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I	Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that Ill stop seeing her?
Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya. (He starts 	Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.	All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!	What?
Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around!	All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let yo
Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!	(He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Chandler?	The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my fr
(He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, well see.	Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)
And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And thats Chandler.	How do ya do.
Hes doin some thinkin!	What happened? What happened?!
Oh, Ill get it. (goes over to the door.)	Gotcha! (laughs)
That doesnt sound like thinking to me!	Sorry!
Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!	Okay, okay, you got it!
Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)	You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you	Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight.
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?	Absolutely!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!	So?
Yeah, were gonna be fine! Get out!	Yeah?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin in there.	Man, this is
Come on, no peeking! (They are leading the gang out with there hands over their eyes.)	Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street. Very good.
Oh no-no-no, its only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.	Yay!!

The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!	Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
All right, that Ill retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it. Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.	Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.

Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.	How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.

So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves!	Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be out all night!
Yeah! All right? Lets go!	And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
and Ross: Yeah!!!	All right!!
(to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?	Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Yeah.	Well, those were seals, man.
All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out.	Yeah, all right.
So, were having fun, right?	and Ross: Yeah.
Im kinda beat.	Actually, me too.
Are you serious?!	and Ross: Yeah.
Yeah, me too.	Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Yeah, I know.	Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.	and Ross: Yeah!
Credits	Im so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, its like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for sever
Hey!	Joey, and Phoebe: Hey!
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.	Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.	Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.	How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
Credits	Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) Theyre lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Umm, that papers two weeks old.	All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it.

Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I dont like guys with boring jobs.	Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I dont like guys with boring jobs.	Hey!
I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation.	Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybo
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?	(he glares at him for a while) Yes.
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?	I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay!
I didnt think you were gay. I do now.	See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.	Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?	(to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.
Hold on, yknow I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?	Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.	Well, I dont really know what that is, but lets!!

Ohh, I like swimmers bodies!	Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Op, I like credit cards!	See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Well, so what does he do?	Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
Your company has a fine foods division?	Its a big company, I dontif youI

You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?	Yeah.
Hey!	Hey, man!
(entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!	Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.	Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didnt tell him that, though? Right?	Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!	Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see.
(singing) Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry	(interrupting) Oh, yknow, yknow what Pheebs?
What?	Im not Jewish, so
So! Ross doesnt really decorate his tree with floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)	Bad dream?
I wasnt sleeping.	Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about?
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.	Prague?
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?	I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!!	Im sure youre right, but why?
You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!	Oh, man. Im sorry, Im so-so sorry.
Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people!	I know! I know!
Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)	Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnt have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)
Really?	Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
No.	Oh, it doesnt matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.	Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadians with no teeth.
Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)	Have you ever been with a woman?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!	So there is no good time to ask that question.
(entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (Hes wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.	I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?	Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?	Well, you-you know what I meant.
No, you messed it up. Youre stupid.	So what job did you get Joe?
No, not really. They give you all the information, its uh, its like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.	Monica, and Rachel: Great!! Thats great!
(entering) Hey!!	Hey!
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!	Oh my God!!
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.	Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.	Yeah.
Umm, (moves her hands down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?	Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. It can with the pants.
You guys are really rightthere arent you?	Yes. Right where?
In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and	Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
And the sex?	All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the big deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.
Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?!	No, hes right, Im totally lying.
Then what is it?	Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey.
And youre afraid you wont be able tofill his shoes.	No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.	Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.	We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.	Yeah?
Go on.	All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.
Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave.	Hi.
Hey!	Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
(to Chandler) So, did you do it?	Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Uh-oh, it was bad?	It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, I see you point, Im all right with it.
Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.	Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, My God! Somebodys killi
All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All right. Now	Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes hot!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than three), five, six, and seven!	(shocked) There are seven?!
Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.	(Points to one) Thats one?
Its kind of an important one!	Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
(continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.	That-thats bad?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the Materhorn.	Well you might if it were anything like 7!
What is that noise?	You!
What kind of changes?	Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) Were getting a second opinion.
Oh, theyre just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.	Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Okay everyone, think thick.	Good-bye! Good luck! (She opens the door to reveal Monica and Joey.)
Shes mad because I know todays her laundry day and that means shes wearing her old lady underpants.	I can check that for ya.
I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.	Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
Yeah, whats that about?	(to Rachel) And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
Five.	Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
Well be starting with apples.	(to Ross) Stop that now!
Well be starting with apples.	Yes!
Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt.	Diet soda.

Okay, the last thing	Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh! (Whispers something in Joeys ear.)
No-no, not for like another two weeks.	I got it! Scotch tape. (Theyre right.)
How did you know she would buy scotch tape?	Well, we used theres up last night making scary faces.
Aww, man!	All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
The test is ready.	Yeah! Yes! (They all right into the living room, all excited.)
Okay, each team will answer ten questions. The first team that answers the most questions wins. Okay, the categories are, Fears and Pet Peeves, Ancient History, Literature, and Its All Relative. Now, 	Oh yeah!
Its heads. (The guys celebrate.) Gentlemen, pick your category.	Fears and Pet Peeves.
(to Chandler) The Irish gig guy?!	His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
(to Chandler) Nana?	She has a real name.
(answering the question) Althea!	Althea?! What are you doing?!
I took a shot.	You're shooting with Althea?!
Althea is correct.	Nice shooting!
I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head!	Actually, its Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Viva Las Gaygas!	Unfortunately that is correct.
All right, we have a tie. Luckily, I have prepared for such an event. (He opens up an envelope and holds up some note cards.) The Lightning Round!	Ohhhh.
You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds.	I majored in lightning rounds. All right, were gonna destroy you.
Huh, wanna bet?	Well, Im so confused as to what weve been doing so far
150 dollars.	Say 200?
Look, we are not gonna	(interrupting) All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.
(shocked) Dah!! (Chandler motions for him to calm down.)	But if we win, we get your apartment.
Okay.	Okay. (Starts jumping around.)
Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie	Dangerous Liaisons.
Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14?	Oh! (Whispers something in Joeys ear and then in Rosss ear.)
Everyday use.	Fancy.
Guest.	Fancy guest.
No, 19.	Thanks man.
Oh my God.	and Joey: YEAH!!! YES!!!
I call Monicas room!	You cant just call Monicas room.
Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you cant guess what color my tonsils are? Ill bet the apartment!	Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Its too nice.
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
Well, freaked. Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alices like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.	Yeah, but I bet it works.
(entering from Chandlers bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving in here!	Well believe it baby!
Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!	I knew it!
I dont care, Im not going anywhere.	Cool, girl roommate.
Dont blame the questions!	Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Okay, but this cant be good for the baby.	Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)
I cant believe were living here!	What?! What-what is it?!
Did you see the size of the closets?!	I cant believe we live here!
Did you see the size of the closets?!	and Joey: Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
	Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
People can hear you.	I know!!
People can hear you.	Wow! She looks great. Doesnt she?
That is one good looking man!	Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy.	Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Thats a good idea for a business!	Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, So wheres your bo
(to Ross) That-that is a good trick.	All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry abo	Really?
Noooo!!	So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.	Yeah, I know but
No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin closer.	Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain are the same thing.
Its this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his butt.)	Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!
All right, lets not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.	Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Its a good play, isnt it?	Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youre having sex with him.
Clearly, Im having sex with him?	Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Okay, so let me just get this straight. Youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?	Yknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.
Acting! Chandler, this is my job! Im-Im playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!	Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face.	Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying this!
Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!	Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon!
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?	Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girls apartment.) Yo
Oh, are we gonna trash that place?	What?!
So you were right?	I confronted her, and she didnt deny it! (Pause) I dont live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)
Are you sure?	Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julies
Beefsteak Charlies?	Yes! See you and I have always been like(motions that they think the same.)
Hi!	Hey!
What the heck is that?	Did she call?
No, sorry.	All right, maybe I should call her.
Hes right, what she did was unforgivable.	Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?	Well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.	She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Thats all youre basing this on?	Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.	Oh my God!!
(opening the door) Hey.	Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Im sorry. Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Oh wow. I really wish youd call me.	Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Yknow, I know for me(Notices a pair of mens pants on the cha
Yeah.	Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Howd it go?	Well, she wasnt sleeping with him.
Oh good!	She is now.
What are you saying?	Im saying that she is a devil woman! Yknow I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I
How? How is your fault?	Because, I-I shouldve called! Yknow if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipple
(going over and picking up the rod) Thats all right. Hey you guys, you know whats going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me tha	Great!
(going over and picking up the rod) Thats all right. Hey you guys, you know whats going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me tha	You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here. Kathy didnt cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.
Yeah.	(opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Oh yay!	Yknow, I cant believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on Im never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! Yo
Oh my God, you guys have no idea.	(they all recoil from the smell emanating from him) Oh! God! Wow!
Hey! Youre wearing pants!	Thats right! Where are the guys? Im ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
Its 9:30 in the morning!	They got a breakfast buffet.
Hello. (Listens) Oh, hey Ross!	Ooh, let me talk to him!
Oh-oh, my God!	Well, can I just

Theyre in Vermont!! How could this happen?! (She waves her arms franticly and hits Chandler.)	Ow!
Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?! (She hits Chandler again.)	Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time.
I dont get this! She was horrible! (She hits Chandler, yet again.)	Okay, Im going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)
Oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remember everylittlething!! (Storms out.)	So yknow, uh, whens he getting back?
A couple of days.	Yknow, I knew something like this was going to happen. (He starts to take off his pants, revealing that he is still wearing his sweat pants.)
What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase!	Yes you can. Youre thinking about time, you cant go back in time.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!	(laughs) No you cant.
Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!	You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)
Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!	Okay. (Starts to cry)
(coming back to the stage and sitting next to Chandler) Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?	No thanks, Mom!
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.	Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.	No! That was a test! In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
You should! How is she?	Ohhh!!
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?	Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
No, I dont.	All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.
Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right. We really werent great at being guys, but you know why? Because were girls.	Yeah?
And do you know what girls are really good at?	Stripping!
Yeah. And yknow, if you wanna cry, thats okay too.	Okay, look, Im gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Come on! Chandler!	Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnt picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)
Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh	(jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!
Really?!	I am totally picturing you with all those women!
Thats-thats not Phase Three.	Well, Im there too!
Well, are we all together? Like in a group?	Stop it! Youre killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
Oh! What is that? What is that?	Where I dont want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
Oh! What is that? What is that?	Come on, let me see that smile.
I dont wanna.	Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!	I know, I know, but youre gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.

Wait, now, what am I doing again?	Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!
No-no-no, that not Joshua.	What do you want from me, Ive never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, Im sorry you cant stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do
	Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Chandler, theres a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)	Thats a mailman! Thats our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?
Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and find	Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?	(entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!

Bye.	Bye.
Bye.	Bye.
Bye.	B-bye!
Bye-bye.	Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After its closed) I cant stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)
What?! I thought you were crazy about her!	Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre all back! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones!
So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here!	Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.	(standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I dont have to break up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike! Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is l
Oh boy, I just love to sing!	Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)	(laughs) Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!	Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.

Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.	But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
(whispering to Ross) Janice.	Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack.
Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you?	Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Hey-hey, whats going on?	Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packing cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!	Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the only way I can get rid off her.
Okay, Chandler, come on!	(to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!

Wow! If only more people knew.	Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.
Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.	Well, were really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.	Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.) (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
Counter Attendant: One ticket to Yemen?	Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Counter Attendant: Im sorry sir, I dont understand.	What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Counter Attendant: Are you travelling with a child?	No. All right, yknow what, shes (Points to Janice) gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Whats the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?	(to the ticket agent) American Express?
Counter Attendant: (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.	Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?	Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.	Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.

Chandler, thats like your fourth cup of coffee!	Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because Im exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!

Look, I told ya, Im not going to any clinic! I dont have a problem, youre the one with the problem! You should go to a Quit being a baby and leave me alone clinic!	They dont have those.
He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.	Next time you snore, Im rolling ya over!

Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? Theres nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua. Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!	What?
Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous! I mean, theyre gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyr	Yeah, well, I dont dance at weddings.
Why not?	Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this (Starts to dancing really, really, really badly. Ross enters behind him and he stops.)
Hey man.	Hey!
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?	Nothing.
Clinic Worker: Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study. (Joey doesnt answer) Uh, sir? (Joey starts snoring)	(answering for him) Yes he did.
Clinic Worker: Alll right, well call you in a few minutes.	(waking Joey) Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!

Oh, youre such a cheater!	(entering) Hello! Little ones.
So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?	Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. (Theyre stunned.) Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Oh, howd that happen?	Because Im cooler.

I know. Ross is getting married.	Phoebe is, making people.
Everybodys doing stuff!	And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
(snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!	No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!	Why not?! I mean its just, its just climbing! Its just, its just steep!
Yeah!	Were going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
Were gonna climb Mt. Everest!	Yeah baby!
Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and yknow you can die. And, you would die!	(dejected) Yeah, well
We could get that Everest video though.	Yeah, we could do that without yknow risking our lives at all!
And while were down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! (Chandlers excited.) Oh, yknow what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.	(dejected) Oh, well

Oh, honey, I dont know. I	This isnt one of those uh, yknow If she doesnt come, we-we dont, we dont come? Right? Because I already bought my ticket
Who's this from?	Oh, that's Ross's.
I can't believe he did this.	Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?	(stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Oh, god.	and Joey: Ohhh.

Credits	All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the book.) Its almost as good as being there.
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!	Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!	If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Hey guys!	Hey.
All right, heres the ring. (Shows Chandler the wedding ring he plans on giving Emily)	(shocked) Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, dont you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?	Oh, its awkward. Its awkward. Its awkward.
Come on Ross! Look, I-I dont have any brothers; Ill never get to be a best man!	You can be the best man when I get married.
(to Chandler) Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?	Oh no-no-no, youyeah, of course you get to be my best man.

Well, theres gonna be strippers there. He didnt say anything about no strippers.	He just said, No strippers.
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I cant use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, whats my next present?!	I dont have anything. (All of the rest of the women there hide their gifts behind their backs.)
Good call!	(banging a spoon against his beer bottle) Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. Ive decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Whats my last name?	Central Perk?

The ring is gone!	Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! Youre the worst best man ever!
Dude, this isnt funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everythings cool! I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!	You slept with the stripper?
(entering) Hey guys!	Hey!
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.	So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.	So you might say, its a magic ring.
My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!	Well, I think it all started when you said, Hey Joey, why dont you be my best man.
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I	Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Stripper: Did anybody call for security?	(to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)
Wheres my ring? My dead grandmothers wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?	Way to be cool, man.
Stripper: Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I dont need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?	Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
So! Things can go wrong! You dont know! What if he doesnt make it?!	He will, Joe.
No, its not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!	Hey, come on, its not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldnt have lost the ring, right? Yknow what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.	No, you should.

Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his pop-up map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up	Oh, what the hell is that?
Its London, baby! All right, the hotels here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna go No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Im gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)	Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!

Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)	All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?	How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
Vendor: Hes just jealous. Youll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!	Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Vendor: (looks around) Theyre all tourists.	All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Thanks.	Okay, wait. All right, thats it, okay, Im out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)
Hey.	Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!	No-no-no, yknow what? I really shouldnt have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnt cool. And if it makes you feel any better, Ive had a really lousy day.

Joey says you dont really like his hat, but I think its kinda dashing.	How did you? How? How?
Umm	Im gonna go to the bathroom.

Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. (No one in the room laughs. He starts to get 
Ohh! Okay, Im going to have to kick her ass too.	(Continuing his toast.) And Im sure were all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. (No reaction from the pe

Well I didnt want everyone to think I was stupid.	So how are you doing?
Geller: All-right fine, but I just want to say, Im not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it werent for us, cheap little man. (Emilys stepmum looks shocked. Jack an	The guy was hammered, okay? Theres no way, you look like Rosss mother.
Then why would he say it?	Because hes crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh, my mothers right. Im never going to get married.	Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldnt want you?

Hey.	Hey.

(With a confused look on his face.) What?	What?
Look weve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachels coming to tell Ross she loves him!!	Oh my god!
I know! Thats why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?	No!! Okay!! Whats with the third degree?! Why dont you just shine a light in my eyes?! (Joey looks totally confused.)
(Using a slightly different inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.	Oh yea, your right. Its the second one.
No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds the phone above Rosss shoulder.)	What we did last night was....
Stupid.	Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
What were we thinking?	Im coming over tonight though, right?
Well, that went well. Yeah.	It couldve been worse, he couldve shot her.
Hello?	Hey.
Hey.	Oh wow, I hope you dont take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, Im just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
I know. How could we have let this happen?	Seven times!
Ugh! Well, yknow, we were away	In a foreign, romantic country
I blame London.	Bad London! (Takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.)
So look umm, while were st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?	Well, I dont see that we have a choice. But, when were back home, we dont do it.
Only here.	Yknow, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
Ill meet you there in two minutes.	Okay!
Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?	Forget it, thats off.
Thats true.	The mans got a point.
Well, look at that, same thing.	Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, Yippee! just ignore me.
Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!	Oh, hello Rachel.

Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?	Well, I suppose Id have to say you!! But, what if were watching a movie in here?
You really think this is okay?	Well, Ross and Emily arent gonna use it.
Oh, its so beautiful. Ohh! Yknow, I-I dont know if I feel right about this.	Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didnt get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!	Okay!
(entering) Emily?!	Nope, not under here!
No, Ive looked everywhere!	Well, you couldnt have looked everywhere or else you wouldve found her!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!	Yeah, for about 30 minutes.

Well, its getting late.	Yeah, were gonna go.
Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.	Yeah, its a very large plane.

I know, Ive been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, dont you think?	We cant do that thats insane. I mean A he could wake up and B yknow, lets go for it.
Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.	Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. (Realizes something) Yknow, technically we still are over international waters.
Im gonna go to the bathroom, maybe Ill see you there in a bit?	Kay!
Can I ask you something?	Uhh, no.
Felicity and I, were watching My Giant, and I was thinking, Im never gonna be as good an actor as that giant. Do you think Im just wasting my life with this acting thing?	No.
I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, yknow, you think Ill ever get there?	Yes.
Thanks man.	Okay man. (Chandler starts to get up.)
Hey!	Hey!
(To Joey) You ate meat! (Joey is shocked) (To Chandler and Monica) You had sex! (Theyre shocked.)	No we didnt!
Well, we certainly are alone.	Yes! Good thing we have that, Not in New York rule.
Right. Umm, listen since were-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy	Right.
Well, an-anyway, I justthat night meant a lot to me, I guess Im just trying to say thanks.	Oh. Yknow, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnt because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me cause, youre really hot! Is that okay?

Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?	Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?	For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
All right!	Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.	Hey Joe!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.	Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in
(entering) Hey!	Hey, Pheebs!

Bodington's!	Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
No, not since I lost her at the airport.	I can't believe she can out run you man!
(entering) Hi!	Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)
(breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one f	Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, Oh, Mrs. Gell	Oh that's not true.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.	Okay, I gotta go to work.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.	And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.	Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)
(Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't watch.)	All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.	Sorry.
What took you so long?	I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, good.	So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her and kisses her.)
(In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.	Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? Well, it's right by my house, all right!	Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. (Gets up to leave.)
(stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to te	I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Phoebe!	Hey, Pheebs!
Okay, woo! Hi.	Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little Y'know, it didn't have any It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic C
Okay, let's go!	Atlantic City!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)	Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!	I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!	Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?	No.
That's all right.	Okay. (They kiss again.)
Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.	That's right.
I'm having my first contraction!	Oh no.
Ooh, it's not bad.	Okay.
Oh! (In an announcer type voice) And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee! (He grabs his side and doubles over in pain.)	Hey! You okay?
Harad: Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your i	Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.	All right
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.	Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.	Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.	So they're going on dates? When?
Harad: Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.	This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
Harad: Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.	All right.
Again, it's not that he	(spotting her) Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.	Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.	Fine! Maybe I will too!
Hello Dan! I'm really looking forward to Saturday night! Really, really!	So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?
Nah that's okay. I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.	Oh.
And it didn't feel so girlie during the Gulf War.	Sure. (Pause) And listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way. (Retreats in defeat.)
Oh, great!	(to another female nurse) Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
Room Nurse: No.	All right. Very good.
Uh, bye Monica.	Bye, momi-moo.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!	Yes!
Chandler's a girl!	Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!	Okay, keep saying it!
Great!	So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.	Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex 
I think you're better than you think you are.	Really? Okay, so
(interrupting) Know when to stop.	Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. (They kiss and as she starts to leave, Chandler starts to dance. Without turning around.) Don't do the dance.	Right!
Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.	Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.	So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
They're gonna call her Chandler.	That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
Ross! Way to suck up to the family.	(entering, happily, with a bottle of champagne, thinking that Monica is the only one there) Ha-ha-ha-(sees everyone)-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax 
(entering, wearing a tux) Hey!	Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were s	Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
(to the gang, whispering) She's talking.	(subdued) Yay! (He motions for them to keep quiet, including Chandler who is still holding the lamp Ross handed him, before he goes off to talk to Emily in private.)
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?	Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.	Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!	Really?! That's what you heard? (To Monica) You said that?
I might've said that. (Chandler laughs.) Why is that funny?	Because I'm very happy for him! (To Monica) And you, you lucky dog!
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.	Yes!
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!	(entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure!	If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.	Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.	Yes!
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!	Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Yeah.	That's true!
Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.	That's true!
Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)	Hey, there he is! There he is!
(on TV.) Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs	How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
(entering) Hi Chandler.	Hey!
Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.	Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.	Expect it in 4-6 weeks. (She starts to leave.) Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?	Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.	Why?
Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)	What's your point?
Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feelOh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)	(entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
Keep talking.	I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHMYGOD.
Really?	Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my When is Joey gonna be home?	Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
But, I just cleaned the bathroom.	Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
Yeah. (She takes them off.)	All right, let's show them how it's done.
Ow!	Y'know that wasn't part of it?
Never done that before.	Nope.
(quietly) Hi!	(quietly) Hi! (They both start kissing.)
Monica? What time is it?	Uhh, 9. (He pushes the clock into the sink.)
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.	I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.	Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!	Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go. (He starts for his bedroom.)
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.	I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Damn!	What's going on?
Hi!	Uh, hey!
What's going on?	We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?	Aww, man! (They go into Monica's room.)
(To Chandler) Can you hear anything?	Oh yes, somebody just said, Can you hear anything?
Ooh, Madlibs, mine! (Grabs it.)	Condoms?
You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.	And condoms are the way to do that?
I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.	(jumping on the bed) I can't believe it! We're here!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!	Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
Come here. (He does, and they kiss.) Okay, be right back.	Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.	(looks at what she's holding and shies away) Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. (He glares at her.) Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be p	Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed! (He grabs their bags and sprints out.)
Clerk: I think you'll find this room more to your liking.	Okay, great. (He grabs the remote and turns on the TV to the chase.)
Clerk: (watching the chase) They say he's only got half a tank left.	Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again.	What? Why?
(To Chandler) Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?	Uh-huh. (He doesn't take his eyes off the TV.)
Chandler!	(turning to face her) Yeah.
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!	I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch-(realizes)-have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!	(watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?	Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!	Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!	Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?	I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?	I said, Geez, relax Monnnnn.
Break	Damn Rollos!
Hey, you're back!	Hey.
How was your conference?	It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)
Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?	Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.	Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)	Monica. (Follows her out.)
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.	Okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!	Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.	and Phoebe: Yeah, me either.
Hi, Rach.	Hi!
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.	Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?	Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.	(entering) Hey!
Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.	Yes that was mine.
'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.	Yes that would have made more sense.
(entering) (He clears his throat to get their attention.) Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.	(entering) Hey!
Hi.	I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
Yeah, it did.	So, I guess this is over.
What?	Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
Why, exactly?	Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh! (They both realize something there.)	So, this isn't over?
(laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.	Really? Okay. Great!
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)	(stops her) We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.	Okay.
(shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!	Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!	Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)
How?! When?!	It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!	The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!	No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
I guess I'm done.	Fun's over!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.	Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! (Starts for his room.) And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, th	and Monica: Okay.
Sorry.	Sorry.
Hey!	Hello!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!	Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. (Phoebe stares at him wide-eyed. Chandler sees her reaction.) That didn't happen, I made that up!
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.	Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.	Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! (He drapes it around his shoulders.) Enh? All right, what do you think?	You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! (Phoebe pinches him.) Which is great! I love to ride that rail!	So you're really okay with this?
Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!	Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
(on phone) I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye. (Hangs up.)	Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.	So, rocks.
Yeah!	Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
I kinda feel like it's my fault.	Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! (He glares at Chandler.)	Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places. (She puts on her fur coat.)	Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Stop saying that. I hate that.	Uh, Ross?
Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.	Yeah, we are so sorry.
Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.	No! Why?
Hi Emily!	Hi!
She's there?!	Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Well, I guess that's it.	Why, what happened?
My marriage is over.	What?!
	Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
No, look. (Shows him the magazine.)	That's a pig.
I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.	Hey! (Joey quickly hides the magazine under the couch.)
Emily's cousin kicked me out!	What?!
Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.	How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!	Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
What?	He thought you said gonad.
(entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!	Love what you've done with the place.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.	Oh yeah!
(To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?	Oh, the tears are real.
Hey.	What are you doing?
Nothing.	You built a fort didn't ya?
(smiles) Kinda.	(notices something) Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was (makes a humming noise.)
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.	I hate this thing!
Ahhhhhhhhhh	(entering) Hello children!
Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?	Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)
All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)	Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing!	You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)
Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?	(gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.	Okay.
All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.	No-no-no-no!
(entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)	Okay, so he's out of here.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, See you ladle. (Laughs.)	Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.	Not even on page 7?
(looks) Oh yeah! You'rehey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!	What about that circled one?
But it's available now! Isn't it?	Yes, it is.
Okay!	There we go!
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.	Let's go quicker.
Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)	Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!	Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
(To Chandler) How about you?	It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.	We are bad people.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!	Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!	Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!	What are we gonna do?
I don't know. Maybe pizza?	About Ross!
Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.	(grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is 
Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.	Ohhhhh!
Yeah!	98. 99. 100. Okay, go!
(getting up) Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine! (He tries to take a step and falls flat on his face.)	Here we go! Here we go!
Hey!	Hey!
You're kidding!	You're kidding, no!
Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there (Points to where the window is but sees that there isn't any space there and points towards his door.) by-by that speaker. Please, jus	Yeah!
Definitely!	Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
All right!	All right, buddy!
Credits	Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!	All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Does anyone wanna watch TV?	Yeah, sure.
That's very nice.	That's sweet, Joey.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not th	Are you aware that you're still talking?
I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.	No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!	It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.	Really? Worse than, More turkey Mr. Chandler?
Oh, let's not tell this story.	Oh, come on!
Hey, it's not like it sounds.	It's exactly like it sounds.
Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!	Arghhhhhh!! (Joey turns around to taunt him, but Chandler is in the doorway and Joey is facing the kitchen.)
(pointing) It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!	I'm over here big guy.
Day	(laughing) You did look like an idiot.
Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?	Which one?
Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.	Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.	(seeing her) Okay.
Monica: Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.	Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Monica: Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?	Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.	Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.	Right on! Oh! Uh, but, dont take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, Im gonna be out with her all night.	Dude, don't do that too me!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.	No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Break	I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
Well, I do.	I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.	I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!	We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
Geller: (To Chandler) God, your hair sure is different!	Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look. (They both quickly push their sleeves over their elbows.)
Hi, Chandler.	Oh my God!
What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress? (She turns around making sure he gets a good look.)	You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
Dude!	Sorry!
Geller: Dude!	Sorry.
Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. (To Chandler) Hey, what's up? (She leaves and closes the door behind her.)	Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
Umm, I'd love too! (She goes over and picks up the box and decides to follow Rachel's advice and holds the box up to her cheek.) Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels a	Okay.
Boy, I love carrots! Oh! (She picks up a bunch of them and holds them between her fingers.) Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. (	Are you all right?
Doctor: You brought a carrot.	What?
Doctor: It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.	Without my toe?! I need my toe!
Day	That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.	That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!	Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail. (He storms out.)
You're a dork.	I can't believe this.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.	Yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?	Yeah, just leave me alone for a while. (He goes into his apartment.)
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?	Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, Quack, quack! Im happy all the time!
Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?	Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)	Look, Monica
Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)	This is not going to work.
I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)	You are so great! I love you!
What?	Nothing! I said, I said You're so great and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!	No I didn't!
Yes, you did!	No I didn't!
You love me!	No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
What am I sitting on?	Top of the world? Dock of the bay? (He tries to think of another but can't) I'm out.
Well, they're not mine!	Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!
Yeah, they're mine.	See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you?	Yeah!
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't	(interrupting him) All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!	Well, yeah actually.
We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.	I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
We are! Help us!	Help!
Hey, Phoebe!	Hi, Pheebs!
Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.	I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Someone at work ate my sandwich!	Well, what did the police say?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!	Ross, it's just a sandwich!
(quietly) That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.	(reading) Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, Keep your mitts off my grub?	Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff. (Writes him a note and the gang reads it.)	Whoa! Ohh!!
Joey, is what she just said ummOh my God. (Looks around the room.) You were actually gonna (Chandler picks this moment to return to the living room.) (Rachel stares in shock.)	What is going on here?
We're so sorry.	Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!	No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your (Thinks) adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?	OhI don't know.
Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.	Hey.
Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview. (Hands him a Polaroid.)	(gasps) You're naked in this picture!
I know.	Ross?
On account of my rage.	Which I may say, right now, is out of control.
Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?	And you're okay with that?
Joey has got a secret peephole!	(Sees the picture) Oh no! No! No! No! (Monica gasps as well.)
No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I just Kinda	All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Thank you!	Joey's a sex addict.
(thinking) I slept with Monica.	Well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
My God Monica!!	Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
(entering, happily) All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!	A test?!!
Ohh, no, no. Were not going to just sit. (Joey sits down and hits the speed dial button on the phone.) Shhh. (It begins to ring.)	(Answering the phone at work) Hello, Chandler Bing.
(In a high pitched female voice) Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.	(Angrily) Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! (Ross and Joey laugh silently.) Its been six months! Its not funny!
But, I love you.	Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!! (Joey hangs up.)
Hey you guys, guess what?	The British are coming?
Ohh, you and your ways. (She shakes the bell at him and sits down.) Since its Christmastime. Im going to be one of those people collection donations.	Ohh.
(Excitedly) Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.	Ohh.
Hey guys.	Hey Danny.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?	Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.	Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
You're driving me crazy with that!	Okay, I'll stop.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.	You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.	Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
(jumping up) All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.	Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.	(entering from his room carrying a fire extinguisher and wearing oven mitts) Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp! Op! (He puts out a small fire which has 
Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks. (She leaves them to wrestle.)	(entering from his bedroom) Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
(To Chandler) I didn't finish my five pages.	Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.	(To Ross) Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.	The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.	Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
How about we settle this right now! (He rips up the tickets.) There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!	I paid for those tickets!
No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!	Oh yeah! (Makes an unintelligible taunting sound.)
Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.	When did that happen to you?!
Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera!	Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
Oh, great!	Okay, bye! (To the gang.) Oh my God!!
Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.	I don't believe they're brother and sister.
Yeah, okay, I'll see you later. (Gets up and runs from the apartment.)	Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Yay!	Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! (Pause) Last night!
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?	Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?	All right. (Takes a copy.)
Hey man.	What is up?
About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.	No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest (Pauses and looks at Joey.) But we had our best friend's interest at heart.	Could I be more sorry. (Looks at Joey.)
I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. (Stops reading.) All right Joey, we get it. (To Chandler) I'm sorry.	(To Ross) I'm sorry too.
(reading from the script.) I am sorry, Chandler.	I am sorry, Ross.
A handsome man enters. (Playing the part of the handsome man.) Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, (Ross) you wouldn	This took you all day?!
All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!	(deadpan, standing next to Monica) We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?!	We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know
Yeah!	(watching the ball drop) 3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!
Yeah!	(To Monica) Happy New Year!
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.	Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.	That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.	I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day! (Ross looks at him.) And it starts right now!
Okay! (She leaves.) (To Chandler and Joey.) Hey!	and Joey: Hey!
I just asked that girl out.	Nice!
Yes it is. See. (Shows them the piece of paper she gave him with her name and phone number on it.)	(reading it) Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.	Horn-swoggle.
You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?	No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. (Sits down rubbing his temple.)
Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them. (She starts to show Joey the chords. Transcriber	What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Auntie Monica!! (He runs to hug her.)	(notices something) Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants? (Pause, no one speaks.) Someone comment on the pants!
I like them a lot.	That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight. (Motions to Ross's buttock.) Maybe there's something in that area.
Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, Wow, (To Chandler) I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before	Oh come on!! (Storms out.)
(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.	(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
No!	Oh my God!
This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!	No. No, you're not a loser.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.	Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty. (Smells it.) Yep.
Credits	(entering) Oh good, okay, I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! (Hands him the 50 bucks he's about to owe him.) Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so 
(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are ha	 What? Oh!
(disinterested) Hey-yeah. (He hurries up to the counter.) Hey Gunther, can I have a scone please? (To the gang.) Wanna hear some good news? Someone I know is getting married! Yeah! And weddings are ha	Sorry man.
Oh, thanks Gunther. (He takes it, hands the plate it's on to Rachel, sets it down on the table, and proceeds to pound it into oblivion while saying.) STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!	Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?	Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.	I know, I can do this. (He takes her hand.)
Hey Bing! (Slaps him on his ass.) (Sees Monica) Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?	I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh, (Points to Monica) this is Monica. (Points to his boss.) This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.
Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?	No, sir.
What was that?	What?
That noise you just made?	Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?	Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right, check me out.	Okay.
says $30 Father; same as in town.	Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
Really?	And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of
Hey, I thought you already had one.	Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks atbigger rocks. (He starts to leave and stops an entering Rachel.) Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.	Okay, good luck with that. (Exits.)
Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!	Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.	Let them win one.
Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.	You're not even giving them a chance!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.	Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro? (Does his work laugh.) (To Monica) Please let them win!
I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.	Oopsey, missed it!
I got it!!	Long! (Gives Monica the Work Laugh.)
I can't believe you let them win!	Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it. (Removes a smashed racquet from his bag.)
I was frustrated.	It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!	If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the I'll see you around, Bing! Not if I see you first, Doug! (	Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
Oh, none for me. Thanks.	Just a little bit of sugar.
(To Chandler) How does that laugh not give you a headache?	Oh, you get used to it.
Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.	So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.	Oh. (Does a double take when he realizes what she just said.)
(entering) Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. (Chandler does not laugh.) Did you hear what I said 	What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?	Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Excuse me?	Well, I just
(interrupting) Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.	Really?
Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?	I think I do! (They all laugh.) Thank you, Monica.
I thought you could use the help.	Coffee in a fight! (Does the laugh again.)
What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!	(from his bedroom) All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!
Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!	But we're not ready to tell yet!
'Kay. (Pause.) Congratulations on your new job. (She goes and hugs Monica and is almost in tears.)	Man, she is really gullible.
Dude, we got to talk.	Okay.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice. (He laughs, his real laugh this time.) What you're-you	Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.	(realizes what Ross just said and the implications to him) I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do ever
Okay.	I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
All right.	And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty (counts his money) seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it downlet's write it down!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!	Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
That was a half an hour?	It's your timer.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!	All right, then massage me up right nice!
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!	Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good, isn't it?	It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!	Good-bye muscles!!
Credits	I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justI didn't know what it was!
Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.	Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
Sorry.	(examining the hat) And the bunny got away. (Turns and starts looking for the bunny as Joey puts the hat on.)
Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing 	And you're gonna make them all disappear.
Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.	Done.
Hey Pheebs, how's it going?	Hey.
Hey!	Hey!
Hey!	Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
Thanks!	Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
That was my dad!	Oh my God!
Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.	And a date with a man!
No he's not!	(wincing) Yes, he is!
What?!	I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
Okay! All right, I'll see ya. (As he's walking off stage.) (Patting the bag.) We got it! We got it!	Hey, is Rachel here?
No.	(coming all the way in) Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell mejust say, I don't like your massages.	(falling into that trap) I don't like your massages.
(starting to cry) See? It's no big deal.	Okay, but now see you're crying!
I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.	What?
(bursting into tears) My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.	It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
Oh my God! You don't know me at all!	Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!!	Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, Who's the best of that? They'd have to go to you.
Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?	Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?	Absolutely!
Okay. I suck!	Yeah! (They hug.)
(dejected) Hi.	Hey!
(dejected) Hi.	Hey man, how did the audition go?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh, (Pause) they had a problem with the bag!	Oh my God!
Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it (Looks for help.)	Oh, hey! (Ross nods in agreement as well.)
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, (Pause) controversial.	Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.	And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!	Good idea! Yes!
Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!	Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.	(entering) Hello children!
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.	Hey!
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.	Hey.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!	Really?
(feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?	Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this.	Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.	What's going on?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?	Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!	Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?	The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?	I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
That's not possible!	Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.	Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.	No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?	Well it's not flexed right now!
Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?	Sure, I'll do it with ya.
No.	That new mountain bike?
Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.	Your work makes me sad.
Bye!	Bye!
Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)	(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Actually, I did!	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!	Are you serious?
Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!	(a little hurt) Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows!
Break	(entering) Joey!
Yeah?	Phoebe knows about us!
And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!	Oh man!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So	Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
(in a sexy voice) Oh? (Takes the phone from Rachel.) Hello you.	Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day. (He's holding the phone so that Monica can hear it as well.)
Eh?	Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Really?	Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
(in the kitchen with Chandler) Look at them, they're-they're panicked!	Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.	(initially worried, but gets over it) Really?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?	Yes.
Oh yeah! (She gasps.) Oh my God! That is our friend! (Monica covers her face.) It's Naked Ross! (Monica turns and buries her face in Chandler's shoulder.)	Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!	Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!	How do you know?!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!	At this?!
Oh now, don't give away the farm!	Phoebe.
Chandler.	Come on in.
I was going too. (They go inside and he closes the door.) Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some?	Sure.
So, here we are. Nervous?	Me? No. You?
No, I want this to happen.	So do I.
No, I want this to happen.	I'm gonna put on some music.
Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)	You look good.
Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!	Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Really?	Oh, do you not want to?
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.	(swallowing hard) Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion.
No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.	Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!	Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!	Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Of course.	Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.	(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.	Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.	Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.	Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
And why not?!	Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!	Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Dude!	And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Chandler!!! Chandler!!! (He opens the door to the apartment but is stopped by the chain; Chandler and Monica quickly stop making out and try to get dressed.) Chandler, I saw what you were doing throug	(To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to
What are you doing?!	Oh, I'm going on the lamb.
(running from the guy's apartment with Joey in tow) Hey, what's-what's going on?!	Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
(To Chandler) I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!	Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids	(interrupting) Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.	Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
Hi!	Hi!
I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?	Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For e	(To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.	Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.	Wh-wh-why?!
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.	Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know	I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date
No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.	Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Isn't this great?	Hmm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?	Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)
Are you okay?	Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?	I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!	What?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.	Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!	Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!	Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!	Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at 	Well, I did not know that.
Break	It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.
and Joey: Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.	By me?
Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?	Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.	Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What?!	Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.
3-B!	Oh yeah, aww!
#3: Yeah, leave!	Yeah, get out! Now!
Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.	Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
(raising her hand) I'm Monica.	I need to talk to you, it's urgent!
Okay.	Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!	(getting out a ring box) Monica
No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!	Will you marry me?
Chandler, why are you doing this?	I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler.	I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?	No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?
(kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.	Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!	Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)
Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.	I didn't think I was!
Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?	Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)
Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?	Okay, how long is this going to go on.
This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole We were on a break thing? Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)	That's not funny.
Hey!	Hey!
What are you guys doing up?	Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
(thinks) Dark red.	Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. (To Monica) Hey, how about maroon?
All right, I'll see you in the morning.	and Monica: Okay.
Wow!	Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. (No one laughs.) Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better 
(entering) Hey, you guys!	Hey!
What's with him?	Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.	Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
(To Phoebe) Hey! (Sees that Monica's there.) Oh.	Hi, Joe.
Nothing!	Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, (pause) but I don't want to talk about it. (Starts for his room.)	Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? (Imitating what his famous speech would sound like.) I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it.
Well, it involved Monica.	You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! (To Monica) I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. (Seeing Monica's stare.) (To Joey) Anyway 
No!	No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Um-hmm.	Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
(looks at her) Not really.	Well there you have it!
No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'kno	Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
(entering) Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?	Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Well, I brought the next best thing.	(entering) Hey!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!	Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so
No! That's-that's my arm!	(looking at the sketch) Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Okay!	Okay.
All right, ready?	Yeah.
Turn.	(straining) Okay.
Turn! Turn!	Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! (They start up the stairs again. Chandler is between the couch and the wall now.) Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.	and Rachel: You think?!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.	Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!	Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman. (Starts for his room.)	(stopping him) Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
(entering) All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!	Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.	and Joey: Nice!
Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.	(To Rachel) He has a gun!
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!	Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!	(entering) Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
You are so cute. (She goes over and kisses him passionately.)	Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
No!	So what happened?
Well, I didn't know what else to do!	Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!	Come on, Rach.
No, in Ross's building! (He throws Rachel onto the chair and heads to the window.) She's back! She's back! (Pantomimes) Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. (He counts where she is again.) Got 	I gotta check out this hot girl! (He heads to the window but realizes something, stops, turns and points at Monica.) There she is! (He dances over to her and kisses her.)
Oh. (Realizes.) Ohhhhhhhhh.	(To Gary) So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.	Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you (He gestures and spills some of his coffee.)
Okay. (She gets up and walks over to Chandler.) Chandler? Can I see you for a second?	Uh, yeah.
Okay. (They walk away to get some privacy.) We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}	Why?
'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!	Ohh, so?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!	Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm sa
I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)	That was amazing!
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.	That was amazing.
We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.	No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.	No, you're the best.
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?	Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?	Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Hi Chandler.	Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?	No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!	Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!	(gasps) So?
I feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.	Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?	Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?	Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact tha
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.	Yeah?
Yeah. (They hug.)	Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Did not.	Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.	Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at hi
Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!	(entering) You guys ready fore the movies?
Okay, pick a card.	Okay. (He picks the 9 of Spades)
All right now, memorize it. (Pause) You got it?	Oh yes.
(holding up the Queen of Clubs) Is that your card? (He winks and smiles.)	(pause) Yes.
Hi!	Hi there!
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!	That.
Luck!	Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day	Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!	Good luck! Go get 'em! (Rachel exits.)
They're gonna do it together.	Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Yeah.	Weirder than watching his two moms make out? (Monica nods in agreement.)
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!	Yeah, it is the best.
Yeah, I can do that.	Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Oh good!	Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?	Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.	Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.	Y'know I rued the day oncedidn't get a whole lot else done.
What? Chandler! Tell 'em!	(shocked) Well I mean, let me get the door first. (Goes and opens the door.) Oh, hi! No one. (Exits.)
Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.	Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
I did not!	Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!	I wish I had smoked for my career
No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.	Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding. (She's not; she stands and walks away. Chandler moves closer.)	I think you smell great! (He sniffs her shoulder.)
(To Chandler) Check it out! Cup hat! (Points to her hat.) Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup! (Holds up one.)	Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
(following him) And did you notice the ice? (Gestures to 3 huge buckets of ice on the table.) Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! (Pours some water onto the dry ice, causing 	Awesome!
Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!	There are snow cones! (Monica glares at him.) Snow cones! Yuck!
Y'knowgo! Go! Right there! (Points)	Thank you! Thank you! (Runs to the snow cone machine.)
(noticing her) Oh, look! Look! Look!	Surprise!!
Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!	Surprise!
Credits	(to Kim and Nancy) Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.	Okay, great.
(to Nancy) So we talked about the (Chandler sneaks closer to her cigarette) whole presentation yesterday at lunch (Closer) and he wondered if one person would be enough (Closer) to get a take on the t	I'll catch you guys later. (Exits.)
Hey!	Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?	Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! How'd you get in there?	Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Girl: Hi Chandler!	Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.	Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
It's uh, 27 dollars even.	Oh, okay. (Hands her the money.) Here you go.
Hey, where's the chicken?	Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
(laughs) Great. I'll see you later!	Okay, bye!
What the hell was that?!	What?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!	I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. Somebody got a haircut (Makes some whiney, nasally noises.)	Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Yeah, right.	You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting. (Starts to move towards Ross.)
Don't get me started on that.	I was not flirting.
Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!	I was not and oh God, shh!
Well	Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
This is so cool!	So, Joey on Law &amp; Order, you must be very proud!
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.	I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. (She just stares at him.) I've done it again.
(entering from the bathroom) Hey! Happy Anniversary!	Happy Anniversary, 10 months! (They kiss.)
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London	Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there. (Points)
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?	The one that doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready.	Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special.	Okay.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.	If you said, Big lima bean, bubbling up. Would she understand the difference?
Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money.	Here you go. (Hands her the money.) Now stop bringing us pizzas you.
I'm gonna try. (Walks away and Ross closes the door.)	You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her, could ya?!	What?
Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!	Thank you for that! (To Monica) I was not flirting.
Really?!	Really?!
It's no big deal, I do it all the time.	(starts to laugh, but then gets serious) So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!	Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
Chandler, this actually bothers you?	Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
(smiling) Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.	(smiling) Well, what is it?
(smiling) Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.	(smiling) If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Tribbiani: No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.	Doesn't know, Hello. But she knows Capricorn One.
Ohh! I did not get that.	So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law &amp; Order?
Yeah, it's good.	See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law &amp; Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Chandler! (Joey and his grandmother shush them and wave them away, which they do.) Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.	Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
Go on, teach me something about men and women.	Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, I'm just flirting, no big deal. But the guy is thinking, Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with
No way!	It's true.
Well that's pathetic!	Again true.
And this goes for all guys?	All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
Tribbiani: Joey!	Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back! (Tries to pantomime it for her.) Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. (Pause.) So, you're old and small.
(running to the door) Oh, mine! Mine! Mine! (to everyone) Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting.	Okay, hold on. (Pauses as he readies himself.) Okay. (Walks away.)
You'll see. Okay. (Readies himself.) Oh, what's-what's her name?	Caitlin!
Gas? Wow! Intense.	(To Monica) If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
A lot of other gas smells	Oh the humanity.
(To All) Was I talking to her about gas?	More so than anything else.
(entering) Hey! Is the show still on?	Almost over man.
(says hi to his grandma) Look! Oh! (Pointing out the window.) Is that the Pope?! (Chandler and his grandma turn to look and Joey slips a tape into the VCR.)	Why am I looking?
That's right!	You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
Tribbiani: Joey, bravo! (Starts with that Italian stuff again.)	(singing) Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdownengineson!
Oh, then no.	(To Monica) Hey!
Hi!	You ready?
Yeah.	You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.	Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings	(looking at them) They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have good taste!	(To Ross) Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Oh, yeah, good idea.	Hey man, what's up?
Okay!	Yeah, yeah! Me too!
Really?! You?	Yeah.
Well, it's kinda dangerous.	Well, I like danger.
and Ross: Yeah!!	Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
(to Gary) That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.	It is starting to get dark out there.
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.	(laughing) Okay. (Deadpan) But it is officially nighttime.
(dejected) Yeah okay. (To Chandler) Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.	Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.	(leans in and takes a sniff of Joey's sandwich) Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Did I say you could smell it?!	I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!	Okay, I'll give them back. (Exhales strongly through his nose and Joey just glares at him.) Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.	Okay.
Are you thinking about Monica?	Yeah.
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.	Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!	How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!	Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Sorry! Sorry! Oh, (He sticks it under his shirt) there! (It's just there flashing through his shirt) Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!	Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Noooooooo!	Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.	(deadpan) Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Is everything okay?	What's going on?
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!	Uh, HELLO!!
My God, Joey!	(pouting) It was a car backfire!
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.	Who jumps at loud noises!
Wow! I could've died tonight.	Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. (He gets up and starts for the door.)
I do have a newfound respect for life.	(returning) Oh my God! (Storms out.)
Dude! How come you took off?	Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever
Is something wrong?	No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.	You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!	I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.	What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!	Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! Iknewyou could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!	When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.	From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense	Much sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!	So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is (Goes and picks up the sandwich) the greatest sandwich in the world!	So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!	Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, (He unwraps the sandwich and holds it out for Chandler) here.	Thanks. (He grabs the sandwich.)
How good is that?	(with his mouthful) Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?	Hm-hmm. (Goes to take another bite.)
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!	I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.	Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.	Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
I'm fine, thanks.	(To Monica) Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.	Okay.
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.	Hiya doin' pumpkin?
I can't believe this!	(terrified) Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!	Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go! (Breathes a sigh of relief)
No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!	So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know. I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him!	Me?! Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him aman!	I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet! (She kisses him and turns to add some sugar to her tea.)	(To Phoebe, behind Monica's back) Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem. (When Monica turns back he smiles and kisses her, when she turns away he nods that he'll do it to Phoebe.)
I know! (Looks at the ball in his hands.) Don't switch hands, okay?	Hey ladies! What are you in here for? (Laughs at his joke.)
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?	Gary, I'm here to report a crime.
Yeah?	It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
(laughs, then suddenly serious) What's up?	Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.
Sure. Okay.	Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.	You mean scared.
No, I mean happy.	Scared? Happy?
Chandler, what-what are you doing?	I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she'
I know! I can't wait!	Were you're parents happy, or something?
Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I justI wanna be around her as much as I can.	Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So you know what I'm talking about, right?	Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!
No, it's too soon for you guys.	(pause) Yeah, you're right about that.
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.	Hi!
Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?	Yes I did, and I think you should do it.
What?!	He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!	Im sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.
Hey Chandler.	Hey Gar!
(catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!	Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right baby.	All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)
(jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!	What?
Oh yeah, that's right!	I'm not a dropper!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?	It's throwing and catching!
All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)	Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)
I tried! They won't take her back.	Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.	Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
and Gary: (entering) Hey!	Hey!
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!	Congratulations! Congrats!
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?	Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Please! I made this game what it is.	Not fun anymore?
Oh yeah, that's over.	What?!
Oh yeah, that's over.	Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
He shot a bird!	Oh that is over!
He shot a bird!	That's terrible! I'm sorry!
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!	All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the game.)
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)	You guys wanna eat here?
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)	Yeah! As long as we're here!
No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)	Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and 
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend!	Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice!	Okay, so Richard, Richard!
Oh God, here we go!	What?
(flinches) Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?	All right, fine.
(freaks) Ross! Stop it! Come on!	How much did I love The King and I? (Oh, you get the point by now.)
Just stop it! Come on!	You okay there man?
(after he's gone) I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!	Wow umm, calm down.
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?	Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
(entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!	You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!	Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.	Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
All right! Thanks Pheebs!	Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Oh umm, not go.	All right, great, road trip baby! (To Monica) This okay with you?
Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.	Thank you.
Damn!	(entering) Hey!
Hey! You ready to go?	Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)
Hey! You ready to go?	What?
Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!	Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.	I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.	So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
All right!	All right, bye-bye now!
I wanna say good-bye at the car!	Okay!
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.	We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.	Yeah.
You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!	Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?	I don't know.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!	Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?	Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?	No!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?	No!
(shocked) What?!	Yes.
Dude you said, No!	I also said, Yes!
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?	No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!	Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!	They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.	Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.	Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!	All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!	All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) Get out!	You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!	All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Eh! Stop it!	(entering) Hey!
Hey!	Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Hey!	Why?!
Hey!	I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
That game should not be played without my supervision.	Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it d
What's in the bag?	Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)	(who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.	Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.	That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!	Really?
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!	(entering) Hey!
(to Joey) Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?	(To Phoebe) Is that Joey?! (She nods yes) Let me talk to him!
Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.	(To Phoebe) Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Yeah! (She hands the phone to Chandler.)	(To Joey) Hey!
Don't come out here!	No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!
I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!	Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
Tourist: (To Joey) Would you mind doing a picture with us?	Uh, what was that?
On a totally different bet.	(entering) Hey!
It's almost our anniversary!	I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.	Huh.
I got you a present!	Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)	Okay.
(grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!	Wow!
For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.	Do we have to?
No.	Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!	Yeah, I think we should see other people.
But we can go, right?	Yes.
Okay!	It's a great idea. (They kiss)
Okay, I'm gonna go too!	Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.
Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.	(coughing) Art lover!
What'd you say?	I said art lover.
Is that supposed to be an insult?	I don't know, I'm very tired.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?	So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)	Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)	(To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.
Aww! I love you!	Can I give you a present now?
Okay!	Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Dont tell me I did this!
I love the I forgot the present fake out!	How do you feel about the, I really did forgot the present, please forgive me not fake out?
Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.	Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
(sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.	What-what Richard thing?
Oh no. [The patented version.]	What Richard thing?
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniv	(talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.
Really?!	Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)
For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a pictu	Oh my God.
Hi!	Love your condoms my man.
They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.	Why?! What happened?!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.	No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!	No! Her boyfriend Richard!
It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?	When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.	Thanks. (They hug.)
I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.	(pushing her away from another hug) Next time?
Ooh, so close.	There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!	That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.	Fine with me!
No it is not!	What are you talking
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.	Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right	(interrupting in the nick of time) Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.	Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!	Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! (Mimics it.)
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!	Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!	I see.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!	(totally confused) What?
My identical hand twin!	What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!	Are you sure you weren't (pause) looking at your hands in a mirror?
Dont you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!	(totally confused) How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!	Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand (Holds up his left hand) twice? Huh?	(Pause) Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?	No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Ohh, you are so lucky! (To Chandler) Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?	No!
But she just came up here!	That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.	Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!	Really?
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.	Okay. (He gets up and goes to find her.)
All right baby, come on! (Rolls the dice) Yes! Yes! I am on fire!	(walking by with his luggage) See you later Mon.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!	What does it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why? (He turns and heads for the door and she chases after him.) Chandler! Chandler! Wait! Im sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if y	Come on! I was there! (He's propped up with his hand on a statute of a naked guy. He winces and pulls his hand away.) I know he's the love of your life.
Not any more.	Really?!
Really! (They hug and kiss) All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary. (She picks up his suitcase.) Okay, this is empty.	Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
(seeing her) Get out of here you lurker! (She doesn't move) Go on! Get! (She throws a quarter at her.)	(arm-in-arm with Monica) Hey Pheebs!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.	Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love. (They start kissing.)
(shaking the dice) A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man! (Rolls the dice.) Yes!	Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?	Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Pick a number! That is your only job!	8. 8!
Thank you!	If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Thank you!	Yay!!
Yes!	Yay!!
(To Chandler) We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?	Noo!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?	Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
What?	Two fours.
Drunken Gambler: (To Chandler) Don't you let her go! You're a lucky guy!	Thank you, Mister Drunken Gambler! Okay, you get this and uh, we get the biggest suite in the place! (Everyone cheers) Wait-wait-wait-wait! We (motions to Monica and him.) get the biggest suite in the
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on! (Rolls the dice.)	(sees the roll) Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with RichMe neither! Okay, what do I want now?	Another hard 8.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!	Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight; (pause) and we get married here tonight.
Gambler: Go! Come on! Roll!	Roll-roll!!
What did you just say?	You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!	Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.	Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What
Okay!	Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay!	(spots one) Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!	All right!
Nobody move! (To Chandler) Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!	Here it is! Here it is!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.	It's a four.
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.	Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! (Picks up a blue sweater.) Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You're so efficient. I love you!	Let's go! (Starts to leave.)
No-no-no! We need something old!	Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work!	I don't think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!	(looks around) Here justtake this. (Hands her the sweater.)
That's stealing!	No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh. (Rubs her fake stomach.)	Okay, one thing at a time. (They run out to get married.)
Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! (Being dragged out by the guard) I'm your hand twin!!	Hello! One marriage please!
Attendant: Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.	and Monica: All right.
Attendant: Well, there's a service in progress. Have a seat.	(singing) Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!
What are you doing?	Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?
No, only because that's the graduation song.	Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
Credits	Okay! (Stands up) This is it! (Claps his hands) We're gonna get married!
Whoa!	Oh my God!
Okay! Okay! Okay! (They run into the chapel.)	Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
(to her) Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey! (Sees Chandler and Monica standing there.)	Hey!
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isnt that why you guys are here?	Yes! Well that-yes.
Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?	We actually missed it.
Whats the big deal, yknow? Its not like its a real marriage.	What?!
All right. Although I dont think we need one, I never stopped loving you.	Hi!
Hey.	So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Where is the waitress?! Im starving!	Its a buffet man.
Oh, heres where I win all my money back! (Gets up and heads for the buffet table with Chandler in tow.)	Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! Whats up? (He grabs a plate and proceeds to load it with a huge pile of scrambled eggs. Chandler just stares at him and Joey reluctantly gives him a spoonful.)	Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! Thats huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasnt invited? And who was going to be your best man? Dont say, Ross. Do not say, Ross.	Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Mo
Oh! Tell her shes not marriage material.	What?!
Good! Good! I was just testing you.	(returning with Joey) Hi.
Girls: Hey!	Hey!
What?	Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
(gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)	(not quite sure) You did.
Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)	Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this ones free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free.
Youre thing. Youre thing. Yknow? Youre the guy who gets divorced.	Oh yeah!
So, what do you think we should do?	I dont know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you! (They hug.)	So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!	Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then theres a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married.	Sounds great.
Ready?	Ready!
(sarcastic) Come on eight.	(deadpan) Yes, yes eight.
Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight.	That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasnt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.	Thats right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?	Yeah. (They go pack.) Were doing the right thing, right?
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.	Well you did pull his hair.
He took my snack!	Im not getting into this again!
Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad.	Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)
This doesnt mean anything, does it?	No!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)	All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the way things are!	Me too!
I dont want things to change! Do you?	No!
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving me insane!	Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving me insane!	(entering, slowly) Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.	Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense.	Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying?
Live together? There have been no signs for that.	Me asking is kind of a sign.
YES!!!!!!!!	Okay!!!!!
Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!	Okay.
Heres your key (Gets him one.)	Oh thanks.
Heres your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!	The door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!
Ready!	Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I cant get in!
Wait! Oh my God! I cant get out!	This is not a sign!
No, its not a sign! Its a very old key!	Its an old key!
Oh my God its old!	I love you!
I love you!	Are you hugging the door right now.
No.	Yeah-yeah, me neither.
What are you doing?	The keys stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)	(trying the handle) It still doesnt work.
Im not finished.	Oh.
Im not finished.	Nice job Joe! Youre quite the craftsmen.
note: In case youre wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller 	Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?	No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?	No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, Joey, I have too but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, go to the bathroom. He may think Im sick.
Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. Okay? Thats it.	Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much.	All right.
Oh my God! Youre pregnant!	No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, heres the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving out man.
Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like youd believe that. This sucks!	Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you!
And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)	(entering) Hey!
Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!	(looking down) What gave me away?
I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and shes the only one left!	Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official, were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
No.	Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.
Hey!	Hey.
Ugh, the worse day! Yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.	Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were call	Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty
What?	(To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
And Chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late.	Rach
I am so attracted to him right now.	Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Soon! I-I just couldnt before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend!	Well, Joeys my best friend.
Im not your best friend?	You just said Of course youre my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
All right, all right, at least Im prepared.	Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
(slapping his hand) Hey!	Hey-hey!
These arent for you! Are you upset?	I am now!
(entering) Hey roomie!	Okay, bye! (Exits.)
God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers? Cant, its not there.	Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.	Not once did we do that.
(entering) Hi.	Hey!
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.	Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)	And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Its like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channies!!	Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
	(entering) Hey!
Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?	Pheebs, I dont understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
Yeah, yeah I think Im gonna find my own place.	Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing man!
Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.	Who was it?
Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?	Sure!
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards	Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real on
No.	Okay so you mean no as in, Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely.
Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.	So, thats it?
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.	Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game!
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?	I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
Are you mocking me?	No, Im not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)
Hey, whats up?	Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)	(reading the ad) Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. Nice!
No. No, I wont. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really d	Hi.
Hi.	Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you. (Monica glares at hi
Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) Im sorry too.	Really?
Yeah! Oh yes!	Ohh.
Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.	Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally!	We dont have to come up with this now.
Oh good.	Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?
Changes?	Yeah, I mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)
Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?	Is that a problem?
Well, its a set and they should probably stay together.	Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over.
See now-now youre taking them away from their home.	Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!
Yeah-yeah, yknow what? Yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt ma	In the game room!
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!	All right! Thats fine! Thats fine! I wont bring over the chairs! I wont bring anything over! I wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandmas place!! (Storms out.)
Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?	(entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! Ill be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)
Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.	Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!	Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)
(stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. Do you really want	Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Love is the best medicine.	Thats laughter.
Why do you do it?	I dont know.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?	Yeah, I do.
Thats very funny!	Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachels room) could destroy you!!	Yeah, I'm not so worried.
You still want to move in together right?	Of course!
Ross didnt scare you?	Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Come here, I want to show you something!	Okay!
Come here, I want to show you something!	Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man!
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen.	Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Okay!	Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say Merge?
Uh-hmm.	Yknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge!
Oh my God! I love that!	Really?!
Credits	Hey!
Hey!	Oh, whats the matter?
Well, you know that psychic I see?	Yeah?
Well, she told me that Im gonna die this week, so Im kinda bummed about that.	What?!
I dontshe said yknow that Id have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.	Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?
(entering) Hey everyone!	Oh hi!
Hey uh, well, todays my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?	Oh thatd be great. Sure!
Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler an	Why dont you open with a joke?
Open with a joke? Its a university, not a comedy club!	Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not talking about Chuckles University?!
(gets up) Okay!	Ohh! Were kidding! Oh, were kidding!
I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.	Thats the way I did it til I was 19.
I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.	Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?	Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.	(opens and reads it) Benefits lapsed.
Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.	Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
Let me see that!	All right.
(reads it) Oh, I cant believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now I gotta be careful?!	Im sorry man, theres never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.	Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
Bastard!	Hey!
(in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time.	Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
What?!	Whats wrong with you?
Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious.	This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)	Thats a hernia.
(in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.	Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!
Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing.	I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just get that thingpushed back in.
Hey!	Hey.
Whats going on?	Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!
Eh, better her than me! Hey, lets bake cookies!	Listen, Im really glad you got the part.
(barely audible through the pain) Thank you.	But are you sure you can do this?
Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.	Now, is that never talking about it again?!
Director: Cut!!!!!!!!!! (Joey starts screaming again.)	Im sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Hey-hey-hey!	What are you doing?
Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.	Oh, all right.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross didnt get the annulment; we are still married.	What?
Okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. But I just couldnt face another failed marriage.	Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Another lie. You have a sickness!	Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya?
Theres a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)	You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didnt realize until I got home. I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Yknow what? Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)	Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!	(not enthused) Yeah, all right.
Okay, well Ill bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre Frank and Alices triplets. Okay, see ya! (Exits.)	Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it.	Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.	Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. Its times like these Im gl
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.	See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?	I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of lookin
That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.	Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
(entering) Hey guys!	Hey!
Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Ive got the keys too, still there!	Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.	What equity investments?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.	You dont even have a car!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.	And?
And six others.	There you are.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.	(entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)
Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out!	He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.	Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
What?!	Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)
How are you still single?!	(entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Good. What made you change your mind?	I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?!!	Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)
(entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his car back.	But you found the keys to his clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right?	That is true.
Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her! (Storms out.)	Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me.
But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.	I think thats gum.
Im pretty sure its gun.	Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go.
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, Yeah, I do! Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean	(entering) Hey!
(exhausted) How do you feel?	Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.	And protected them from a tornado?
But my apartment!	Was the setting of Phoebes triumph.
But the mess!	Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!	(pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!
	(watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that hes scratching his back with it.) Listen, Im gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
Right! And when is that due?	First of the month.
And thats every month?	No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Ahhh.	Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)
(looking at it) Oh my God!!	Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover you for a while?
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityanymore.	Its not charity, Joe
No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on.	Okay uh, heres the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!	Uh, yeah.
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!	So, well do the rest of the bills later then?
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?	No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it.
Well, how much do you think he needs?	I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride.
Why dont you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.	Well that would help the pride thing.
(entering from her room) Hey!	Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
(thinks) Okay.	Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Hey!	Hey!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?	Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.
(entering and interrupting the guys escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, were gonna start with	Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
I thought you said you were going to do nothing.	Yes, but for the last time.
Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?	Hes at a dinner party.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.	Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh thats okay. Hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!	Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.	Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, youre on.	Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
(scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the	Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?	Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!	Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?	No! No! No! No(Joey looks at him)one can beat me.
Okay, here we go. Ready?	See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Break	Still broken?
This sucks man! The last night youre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.	Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)
Nah, not my game.	Okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? We could play a new game. A new game, its fun.
Well, whats it called?	Cups.
I dont know how to play Cups.	Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun.
All right.	Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?
A two and a five.	Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!	Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?
A four and a nine.	Youre kidding right?
No. Why?	Well thats a full cup! (Pays him again.)
Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)	You win.
Well, what did you have?	It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.	Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.	Double it! (He does.)
What?	Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?	Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Dont get to ex
Hey!	Whats wrong?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!	Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sitt	Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think beginners luck, very important in Cups.	All right, lets play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Im serious this time! In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the 	I cant take the big white dog! You love it!
Its him, not it!	No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youre trying to give me money again!	When did I try to give you money?
Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said No, you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody t	Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youre okay.
Bye.	(entering) Hey.
She really left.	I know. (He kisses her.)
Thank you.	No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)
Can I ask you a question?	Sure!
Credits	I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back.	Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)	Its not a real game! I made it up!
Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.	At a fake game!!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Id be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.	Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
No.	Hmm, lets see if it comes up this time. (He looks at his cards and shrugs.)
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your th	(not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
(jumps over a box) Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!	I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!	Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!	So, uh, wh-where ya from?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.	Unbelievable
Oh, so you like her too Chandler?	Hey, look at all the boxes!
Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.	All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Oh God, yeah.	Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
(happily) Okay!	No-no
We'll see.	OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. (Turns around and sees that Joey isn't there.) Joe? (Hears giggling coming from a box) Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still 
(jumps out of the box) I Gotcha!!	(pretending) Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!	Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gon
(raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.	Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
(enters) Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?	What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?	Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?	Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.
Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.	She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?	She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.	I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakout. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.	No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.
(on phone) Hi!	Hey Mon, how's it going?
Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.	Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.	No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?	It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.
Break	We should start with the big stuff. Yknow? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. (He picks up one end and Ross doesn't help) I got it. (He moves it back to where he thinks it goes.)
Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.	What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the...(Tries to rest his feet on the coffee tab
Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.	OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.	Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.	Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato fam
Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ba dum bum chessh	Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.	That's not specific to girls.
Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.	And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.	Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didnt you ever run so 	Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
Who cares? I repel women.	(blocks the door) No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
(whispers) What?!	(to Ross) I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?	Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!	Bye! Thank God
Dude, what'd you have?	Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
(realizes something) The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.	That's perfect! That's brilliant! (Starts going through the photo album)
Is it okay for me to come in now?	Uh-huh
Bye! (Runs out)	No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it. (Forced laughter)
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.	Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, wh
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?	Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd n	Really?
Of course!	Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
Yeah, I gotta go.	Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Hey.	Hi, my names Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor come on in.	So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, shes at dance class.	Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. She gets really mad.(Chandler gives him a look and walks to the door of his old room.)	(The room is filled with flowers and a floral print sheet on the bed.) Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. (Looking a
(Looking around the room.) It is???	(Picking up a pillow.) Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.	(Pointing to the table and picking up the box.) Is that your tiny little box, thats too small to put anything in?
No.	No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
(With Big Eyes.) All right, youre right. Ill talk to her.	Yes talk to her. Be a man.
Im a man.	Defend yourself.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.	Be right there sweetums. (Monica leaves. To Joey.) A totally different situation.
Hey guys.	Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
It was okay. Shes still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.	Ohh, yeah.
But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much.	Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either.
Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday. (Everybody gets up.)	Yeah lets head off to work.
Hey guys.	and Monica: Hey.
Whats up? (He smiles. His teeth are freakishly white.)	You knowOh My God.
I whitened them.	(Sarcastically) Really.
Ross theyre really, really, really white.	Yeah, what was wrong with your oldhuman teeth.
I know. Thats why I did it. (With a big smile) Come on, are they really that bad?	No, no no no. Youll be fine. (turning to Monica) Hillarys bind, right?
She will be after tonight.	Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)
Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.	What???
Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they justmade out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year.	I am proud of all my friends today.
My God, Rachel, I cant believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, Im so jealous. (Chandler looks at her.)	Hi, Im Chandler. Your live-in boy
Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)	Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose.	Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? Im going to go over to Joeys.
Wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.	Yes, but I feel like Ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. Youre right, Im sorry.	Nah, Nah, its okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joeys. Go over to Joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.	You know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders.	No thanks, Josephine.
Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders.	Hey Ross, I was wondering if Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.	Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)	What is the matter with you ?!?
What?	Youre arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.	Youre turning into a women.
No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean.	Now Ive upset you? What did I say?
(on phone) Okay, great! Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess whos coming to Thanksgiving dinner?	Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
(not amused by Chandlers joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.	Oh! Thats great, they havent seen the place since I moved in!
Yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.	(shocked at the news) Why cant I tell them that we live together?
Because they dont know were dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)	Why havent you told them?!
Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnt.	Why havent you told them?! Wouldnt they be happy?!
(trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! Ill see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)	Why wouldnt they be happy?
Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. Im sorry.	What? What? Why?!
Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.	Is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?
Look, I know that I shouldve told them. I know I shouldnt care what they think. Im sorry.	Yknow, itll be okay. Itll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em.
You really think thatll work?	Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnt I?
Credits	Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! Youre parents like me, right?
(only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!	Well Monica just told me that they dont.
(not paying attention) Yeah, they dont like you.	(annoyed) Do you know why?
I dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. Or maybe its cause you uh-	(angry) Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!
I dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. Or maybe its cause you uh-	This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh?	Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
Well maybe I love ya.	[mocks that last comment].
[to Chandler]: Hey.	Hey.
Hey!	Hey!
and Ross: Hey!	Hey!
Geller: Hi!	Hi!
Geller: (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.	Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Geller: (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.	Whoa, snowing out there?
Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends!	Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Geller: I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?	(worried) Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
Geller: Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.	Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I dont
Geller: (whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think hes stoned again.	(shocked) What?
Okay, I think I might know why my parents dont like you.	You do? Why?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the wind	What?! Why did you do that?
I dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter.	How could it not matter?!
How was I supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?	What about all that friends forever stuff?
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!	Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I cant believe youd do that!	The reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that hes not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, 	Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Its so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.	(faking enjoyment) Mmm.
Its so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one whos eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.	(clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?	(lying) Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
Geller: Chandler! Youve been Rosss best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now youve taken on Monica as well. Well, I dont know what to say. Your	Thank you!
Geller: No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I dont know what Im gonna do about the two of you!	(In a parent-like tone) Ill talk to them!
	Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.
Hey	Hey
That is nice and were done. TADA!	I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to me.
Oh, here.	See now it feels like Christmas!
Hey you guys.	Hey Joe whats up?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Yknow, everywhere I look shes like (He imitates her stretching)	I can see why thats hard to resist.
I know. And shes so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.	You are aware that shes not a monkey, right?
Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!	Ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you? (He kisses her on the cheek)
We are there!	What, what are you laughing at?
Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!	Bye!
Did she just ask me out on a date?	I dont think so.
Oh my God!	(To Rachel) Oh my God!
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.	I can save you time ladies, Im right here.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.	What? Thats terrible!
No-no, we do it every year!	Oh well, that makes it not terrible.
Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK?	No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents!
But we have to!	No, you dont have to, and you cant because I live here too.
Well then, you should look with us.	Why?
Chandler, arent you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?	No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Chandler, thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make 	If I help, we can find em faster!
We are so gonna find them this year.	Yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you?
Yeah.	You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
and Rachel: No, we never do that	Because thats where Joey gave me some stuff to store that Ive never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe
Break	I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!	Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?	Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
Ha!	Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?
Head: Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.	Three, Two, One!
Hey! Look who I found!	Oh, hey guys!
Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.	Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? No! Didnt think so! Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!	Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage?
No, dont look directly at them!	What?
Oh, this ones for Chandler. Here.	Oh great!
Ooh, lets open them!	Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hee hee!	Wait, we cant do this.
and Rachel: Why?	I dont wanna know what Monica got me. Yknow? I mean, look, Im sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to
Whatever Linus, Im opening mine.	Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. 
Will you get us better gifts?	Fine!
Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?	Thats what you got me?
I cant do it! (Ross falls into Monicas room)	Now you do that, youre on TV.
You serious?!	Thats great!
Oh we kissed it up real nice.	So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.	So shes just waiting over there for ya?
I know.	(entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff. (Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.	Im not your garbage man. Im your mailman.
Yeah! Its an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?	A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!	You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Hey! I made that for her!	You made pottery?
Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.	Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.	so then the farmer says, Thats not a cow and youre not milking it. (Everyone laughs.)
I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!	Look at us, were a couple of couples!
Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get the wine right?	Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.	And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. (Hands it to him.) You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
Oh, shes uh-uh really sick.	Oh thats too bad.
Bye. (Exits)	Thats funny, I saw no phlegm.
No-no, she really is sick!	Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Well uh, she didnt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. Im so sorry.	Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
(loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?	So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!	And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first	No, you shNo you said you made that up!!
I know, but dont you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?	Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)
Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.	Okay.
I am loud!	Aww! (They all laugh.)
Oh Ross, calm down, Ill give you the 80 cents. (Ross glares at Rachel)	Okay, one more time.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?	Perfect decibel.
(entering) Hey!	Hey.
So uh, what are you guys doing?	Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah.
Well I did. I really did. And you guys, Ive got to say, Im sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.	Thats totally understandable.
So we can go out again?	Oh yeah!
(bursting in) I knew it!! Yknow, youre not so quiet yourself, missy!	And Im blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)	(To Monica) Yknow I think you can take her.
(chasing her) Youd better run!	Did you hear that?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?	Yeah, Im sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?
How ya doin?	Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Well, when its not right, you know it.	You okay?
(showing them the page) Here, check it out. Its the first one, too.	That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What?	I made that joke up.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. I did.	Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke hed ever heard.
Im sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)	Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No.	Seriously?
Look, Chandler, its my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right?	Yeah, I guess.
(entering) Hey guys.	(jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
No, its my joke, its mine. You can call them, theyll tell you.	Its my joke.
Credits	Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.
Lets go watch it at your place.	Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dont want to miss when they were skinny.
Chandler, Chandler, yknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.	What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?
No, thats VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know	Joey, why is your cable out?
I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill	If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.	Whoa ho.
I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).	(picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.	(with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?
You forget how many great songs Heart had.	Yeah.
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.	And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.	(stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.	Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?	Yeah!
Well, Im not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).	Okay (he goes to sit down).
(visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.	(visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.
Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.	You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? Im going to get a joke journal. Yknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my
Thats a good idea.	Yeah!
Do you know whats a bad idea?	Picking Rachel.
Thats right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?	Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction.	So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape.
See, now its weird again.	I think its great that you work here. Youre going to make a lot of money, and heres your first tip: Dont eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). A
Its my joke.	Its my joke.
Yknow, I dont think were going to settle this.	Lets have Monica decide.
Yeah!	Yeah!
Hey Mon.	Mon, get out here!
Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)	Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Why do I have to decide?	Because youre the only one that can be fair.
Yeah, but Im your brother. Were family. Thats the most important thing in the world.	(to Ross) Dont try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) Im your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go.
Okay, Chandler, you go first.	Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?	Can I finish my story?!
Continue.	So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steves doctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table t
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey!	Im not arguing with that.
Its your joke.	Is not.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.	Hi, oh hi.
Hey, its Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?	(starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely att
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.	(To Chandler) Im out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!	(pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) Youre a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.	Im sorry. Youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that Im pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thats goo
(embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didnt even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right youre off my list.	(happily) Im off the list. (Sits on the couch.)
(to Monica) Yknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.	Hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.	Hey.
Im not answering that.	Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. Im not answering that.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together thats (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.	This coming from the man who couldnt split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Hey!	Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldnt you be at work?
(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I cant work if Im sick.	Ohh!
(congested) Ugh, they sent me home. They said I cant work if Im sick.	Im so sorry youre sick.
(wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)	Im gonna grab you some tissue.
Im fine-d. Im fine-d! Yknow, its a really hard word to say.	Yes?
Oh my God, Rachel!	Oh my God, introduce us!
Yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend.	Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do something crazy!	I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)
Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, then youre coming with me.	That would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)
(wiping her nose) Are you saying that you dont wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesnt work all that well with the big robe.)	Yeah, I dont you should say that even when youre healthy.
(in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)	Dont take this personally okay? Its just that I just cant have sex with a sick person.
Im with you Chandler! I mean I cant have sex with a sick person either, thats disgusting! But Im not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.	Thats the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
(still sick) Chandler!	Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least shes trying too and
(trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.	Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.	I was asleep. (She takes off her robe and starts to shiver) Oh no! No-no honey! Yknow whats sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that Im not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel. (Sneezes.)	Would you please get some rest!
(entering) Chandler, I think Im sick.	Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest? (She hands him some of that Vicks Vap-O-Rub to put on.)	No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!	No-no-no-no-no!
Fine, Ill rub it on myself.	Okay.
Fine, Ill rub it on myself.	So youre just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah?	Its nice.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?	Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)
I cant believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?	Its all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Not now, Im sick!	Oh come on you big faker!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?	Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex	Okay! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Oh yes, its me! Sorry!	(calling from the bathroom) What are you doing here?
Uh, Im just, Im just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?	We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh my God, look-look hes taking off her clothes!	Hes taking off her coat!
Oh. (Squeaks again.)	Ho-oh, hes gonna get some! (Rachel looks at him.) Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with yo
Joey we know you steal our food.	Im good.
Yeah. And yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.	(looking) Is that a swing?
Oh dont even ask!	Yuck!
I cant believe Ross went out with Rachels sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.	That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!	Joey
Oh yknow whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.	(totally not crying) Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
(crying) You didnt cry when Bambis mother died?	Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you dont have to be so macho all the time.	Im not macho.
Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking.	No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not a crying kind of guy.
Come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?	Id be sad sure, but I wouldnt cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.	Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Im rich!
All right, whats going on there? (Points to a picture.)	Oh, thats Parents Day, first grade. Thats me with the janitor Martin.
Where were your parents?	Oh they didnt want to come!
So that story doesnt make you cry?	No! Look, I dont cry! Its not a big deal! Okay?!
Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I dont think its the kind youre gonna like.	You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
(holds up the movie) Phoebes a porn star!	What?!!
(holds up the movie) Phoebes a porn star!	Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood.	Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I dont do porn.
Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?	Her ankle is what youre watching?
Well its hard to tell (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only shes having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.	Shes just doing her job!
Hey sweetie!	Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)
(picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?	Theres no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.	Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.
Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.	Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!	No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this. (Makes a bored face.)
I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)	Yeah?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty r	Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, I will always be with you, and you still cant shed one tiny	Aww, I love you so
What is wrong with you?!!!	What?!
What?! You cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!	So you didnt mean any of that?!
Yeah.	Hey.
What?! You kissed!	(To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Oh my God! Are-are you crying?	(crying hysterically) I just dont see why those two cant work things out!
Bye.	(starts crying) I-I cant believe Jills gone. (They all look at him.) I cant help it, I opened a gate.
Id bet Id still be doing my kara-tay. (Thats karate, hes just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing	Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.	Sure I would!
And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.	(simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.	What, you guys really think that Im that shallow?
Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, theres Carol again!	What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Id probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobs fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I dont have to wear a tie.
Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)	(entering, depressed) Hey.
Oh no! Whats the matter?	Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not Archie Comic funny.
Boyfriend: Bye-bye. (Gets up to leave.) Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut. (Exits.)	Was his question whats more boring than him?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?	Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?	Ehh.
Thats great! That would be great! Lets do that!	I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!	Okay!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I dont need any assistance in there, take a break!	All right!
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)	Hey.
(stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?	Well its kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that hes not real.
(entering) Hey there you are!	Uh-oh, its my boss!
All right, heres a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work Im delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine! (Exits	(reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
(laughs) You realize what you are dont you?	What?
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.	But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
(louder) My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I cant breathe.	Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Honey, having a heart attack is natures way of telling you to slow it down.	I always thought having a heart attack was natures way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But youre not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youre not gonna die today. I wish I was
Sorry. So hows it going with Joey?	Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, Bring me food. Two is, Im with a girl, bring us food. Three is, Im lost and I cant find food.
Okay, you watch too much TV.	(approaching) Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for. (Hands it to him.)
Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, theres pulp in that. (Hands it back.)	Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnt juice. All juice, okay?	Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
(To Chandler) Iced tea.	Okay, anything for you sir?
(To Chandler) Okay look, Chandler, if this (Motions back and forth indicating the arrangement.) you have got to listen! (Tugs on his ear.) (Chandler glares at him.) Youre gonna throw that juice at me,	Its not all juice! (Rachel quickly gets out of the way.)
(quickly) I love that idea!	Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Oh my God! Thats great! Oh wow! (Hugs him.) Youre a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!	Aww.
Wait a minute! (Quickly checks her pockets and pulls out) My last Kit-Kat bar!	You wanna share it?
Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say Im sorry. Here. (Hands him a cup.)	Whats this?
Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.	Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
Oh my God! Thats great! Congratulations! Whats the story?!	Oh you wouldnt uh, care. Its just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!	Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesnt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistas his butler. And then makes him do all these cr
She doesnt know she was fired yet, does she?	No, the doctors say it may kill her.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?!	(To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here! (Points at Ross.)	Listen Phoebe, hes right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!	Uh, what about yknow the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
How hot is this?!	Im sorry youre here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.	Well, I could make it seem like hes here. (Imitates him.) Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the second cous until 1979. (Mumbles something further.)
Stop it!! Thats not funny!!	Okay.
Im sorry, okay? It justtonight was supposed to be yknow, it was supposed to be a big deal.	What was tonight?
You dont want to know what tonight was.	Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
Well, tonight waswas going to be my first time.	With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica shrugs.) Oh my God!
All right relax Mr. Ive Had Sex Four Times!	Four different women! Ive had sex way more times!
How many?	Nine.
I was just waiting for the perfect guy.	Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
No. Hes not a horrible guy.	Hey thats what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, Im gonna die a virgin!	No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?	Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
I was kidding.	So was I.
Come, come here.	We cant do this.
No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?	Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, yknow? Because youve been waiting a very long time and I wouldnt want to disappoint you.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if youre horrible, how would I know?	I do like that.
Its harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!	Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out another friend. (Points at herself.)	Stop it! Were doing this! Lets do it!
Noo!! Okay!!	Okay! (They both get up.)
Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?	I have some moves.
I have no moves. (He moves in to kiss her and she laughs and backs away.) Okay, whatcha doin there?! (Giggles.) Oh yknow what? Im sorry, this is just too weird.	Yeah, lets just forget it.
What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)	Okay!
What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)	Oh yeah.
Chandler?	(sexily) Yeah?
Break	Oh my God!
I know! Ill tell you something, we are gonna do that again!	Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
It really was!	Hey!

Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.	So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Hey everybody!	Hi!

Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run. Ill see you later?	Okay!
Oh that is quite all right maam. (Elizabeth exits.)	So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.	Oh, tell her good luck with that.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?	Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.	Oh thats so funny because we found someone too.
Oh thats good, I guess shell have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.	Why would our guy be a weirdo?
My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form)	A face ass?

You dont understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, Im not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?	Just tell her the truth! Tell her youre not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?	Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Oh-ho-ho, you think I dont know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! Thatll be $400!	Joey, I saw you push him!
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?	Uh-huh.
Hey!	Hey!
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didnt want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that shes going to Florida for spring vacation.	Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)
I went to Egypt with my dad.	I can see it now, Look dad, its the Sphinx! (Does that party noise again.)
Im gonna call her.	Yeah.
Well, yknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think Im just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.	Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!

Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?	You know the hotels?
Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?	Well, maybe you dont marry this one.
Hey!	Good-good-good-good.
Hey!	Hey!

Wh?! What about my allergies?!	Oh right, your allergies. (Monica leaves and to the chick and duck) All her, she hates you. (Chandler leaves without finishing the message for Joey.)
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?	As crazy as soccer?
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) What are you talking about? The auditions not til 5:00! (Chandler suddenly remembers and looks at the unfinished message then tries to sneak over and finish it as Joey list	You mean you didnt get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!	Well, maybe we can fix it yknow? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned my whole career around!	I messed up. Okay? Im sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!	Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right?

Oh! Ross is sooo great!	Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
No, you said the baby creeps you out.	No, the little girl creeps me out.
You said the baby.	Why would the baby creep me out?
(writing frantically) You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?	This is going in your book?
Hey!	Hey!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.	Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants!
Thats not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. (Starts to leave, but stops and turns to Phoebe.) Well, actually I go	So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me?
Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side.	Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
Im not writing about you! Im writing about other people.	Who?
Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, Ill just write about Phyllis! Hmm!	Hmm.
(writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.	Oh.
(still writing) Phyllis sees what Im doing.	Oh-oh.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.	We said seven!
We said six!	The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.
(Turning around in the chair) Hi!	Oh my good God.
I know what time you said.	What?!
Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to the rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.	(disgusted) What does it say?!
I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.	Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks! So are you.	(To Monica) I told you I should not wear this color. (Hes wearing a reddish-orange sweater.)
(reading from her book) Mon (Pause as she restarts) Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks theyre supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks its at seven.	So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
I cant believe Im going to lose this job!	Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah? Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. (They shake hands.)	Hi, how are ya?

Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.	Yeah, Ive been there my friend.
(dejected) Hi, you guys.	Hey!
No! No! Its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!	Ill give up my ticket.
Okay thats so generous!	And I think Ross is generous too.
Hi!	Hey!
Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.	Ross.

Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!	(on machine) This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing! (The machine beeps off.)
(going over to him) Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.	Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday. (Does one of those Chandler noises.)
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that?	Right here! (Clucks like a chicken for some reason.)
Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel	Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.	Okay.
Really?	Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
I know! I know.	Okay. (They hug.)
(entering from her room) Hey, did she buy it?	Totally.
So did Heldi show you the place?	Yeah, its beautiful.
I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!	I know.
	Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I cant figure this out! Its so hard! Should I get her a (turning to each page) Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah! Paper cut!
Now, have you told anyone else?	No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
You told me.	Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.	Me too.
Hey. (Heads straight for the fridge.)	Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?	Oh all right.
Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.	Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
My God, Im sorry! Im sorry! I didnt mean to do that! I wouldnt do that!	Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and I cant find the perfect ring! (Goes over to another display counter and starts pointing at rings.) Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! (Not
Okay, so maybe you dont get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Yknow? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, yknow? Or an engagement tiara? Orooh! An engagement Revolutionary W	Yknow, Im so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?	Yeah, Im gonna stick with the ring. (Goes to another display counter.) Oh, this ones nice! (Pointing to another ring.) I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
Jeweler: Can I help you?	Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
Jeweler: This ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.	Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youhold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Jeweler: Okay. (Holds out the ring, deadpan.) Will you marry me?	(choking up) Oh my God thats it, thats the ring! How much is it?
Jeweler: (angrily) Are you interested in this ring?!	Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
Jeweler: (ignoring her) How would you like to pay?	Uh, credit card. (Reaches for it then realizes) Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. (To Phoebe) Okay, Ill go get it. You guard the ring.
Rachel?	No. How are ya Paul? (Starts to look for his credit card.)
(acting manly to try and cover up his crying) Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?	No, did he hug you?!
No! No! Its just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.	Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey Chandler?	Yeah?
Would you.Would you hug me?	Im a little busy here Paul.
Thats exactly what my dad used to say! (Starts to breakdown again.)	Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. (Paul rushes over and hugs Chandler tightly.) Oh hey! There you go. (The hug continues.) Okay. (The hug continues.)
Five more seconds.	Okay! (Pushes him away.)
Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! (Motions to Chandler, Whats going on?) Hi, Paul is it? (Paul nods yes and still hugging Joey.)	Do you have my credit card?
Yes, its in my Inin my pocket. (Paul hasnt dropped him yet.) (Chandler starts to reach for his front pocket.) My back pocket! My back pocket!	Thank God! (Grabs his card.)
Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.	Oh, I cant go.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring. (Holding it out for her.)	Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!	What?
Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!	They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!	Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.	Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.	It was the ring!
(entering from her room) Hey.	I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
Its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Its a beautiful ring!	No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it r
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.	I cant do that.
There he is! (Points.)	Okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Wow! Youre good! After this, we should solve crimes.	Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
(To Chandler) Here he is.	(to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back. (The guy isnt sure.) Bu
It is beautiful, but Im gonna use this one. Now, if youll excuse me.	No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You dont want to break her heart now do you?
Youre dying?!	Yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity	(interrupting her) Okay, thats enough honey!
I dont know. (Pause) Let me see the ring.	Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)
(looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and hes horrified.) Hey! Im marrying a dead woman!
(looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)	Guys? (They ignore him.) Ive got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) G
Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?	Yeah, check out the ring. (Shows it to them.)
So you two are really serious?!	Yep, pretty much.
And-and-and-and-and-and, and were gonna be friends again!	(goes to hug him and stops short) HeyyyyWhat?

Whats the big deal?	I just get mad when Rachel doesnt remember where were going.
Hey, yknow what? Ill come too. Im making money now; its about time I give something back.	Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.	Oh, so youre already doing your part for the kids.
Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?	Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnt agree to that!
Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?	Yeah! Yeah, sort of. Im sorry.
See? Now, he could date her.	Will you marry me? Will you marry me? (Makes like a gun with his fingers.) Hey, you marry me! (He gives up as Joey, Rachel, Phoebe, and Ross slink in all excited.) Whats going on little elves?
Yeah, yeah you have the ring?	Yeah, right here in my pocket. (Pats his pocket. Phoebe smiles, goes over to hug him, and removes the ring from his pocket.) Pheebs?
Oh! Oop! (Hands him back the ring.)	Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and shes gonna know.
Hi guys.	(To Monica) You are beautiful.
What are you doing?	(trying to cover up why his hand is over his heart) One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. (Laughs.) I remembered it. (Its a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance
Are you okay?	Yes! Yes! Im good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everythingare youare you perrr-perfect?!
Yeah. Im okay. Im actuallyIm a little cold, can I have your jacket?	Oh, yeah. (Starts to take it off and then realizes) Uh, no you cant have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you shouldve brought your own jacket. B
(laughs) Are you sure youre okay?	Yes! Im fine. In fact Ive been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Ohh thats sweet!	Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldnt imagine growing old with
(interrupting him) Oh my God!	(not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.
Oh my God, Richard. (Yep, Richards back.)	What?! Im Chandler! (She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, thats Richard!
(approaching them with a woman in tow) Monica! Chandler!	Hey-hey, hey! (Gets up and hugs him.) I dont know why I did that!
Well, my nose got lonely.	(to Richards date) And uh, you dont have a mustache which is good. (She just smiles.) Im Chandler; I make jokes when Im uncomfortable.
Date: Hi, Im Lisa.	Hi.
Oh, Im sorry. (Introduces them.) Lisa, (nodding at each) Monica, Chandler. We used to date.	Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.
Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down?	Yeah, Ill sit down. (He slides back into his chair.)
Oh. Good to see you guys.	Yes. (Thinking hes gone.)
Note: For further reading on the above story, please check out  The One Where Joey Moves Out.}	I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Ohh.	What?!
Oh my God, you guys!! (Hes excited about what he thought happened.)	(stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who?	Richard!
What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh thats right thats right. Thats Richards favorite place too.	Oh you knew that. Good!
Shes leaving for three months.	For camp!
Ive got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.	Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year!
(suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebes wishes.)	(after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
What happened?	Richard was there so I couldnt do it!
What?! Noooo (Phoebe gasps.)	Im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, but now youve ruined it!
We didnt ruin it!	Who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands?!
Good one! Yeah.	This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.	Thats right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! Convince her that youre a little coward!	I can do that, Ive had 30 years of practice.
Okay, break-ups still on!	Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
Hey!	Hey!
What are you up too?	Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government 
Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.	Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!	Eh
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?	Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundre
Yeah, but thats pigs not people!	If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?	Well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!	Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?!
Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!	(to them) Its okay, I got a plan.
Where the hell have you been?!	I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!	What?!
Yeah! Yeah, Ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off!	MyOh my God!
I know! They suck!!	Hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! Im supposed to do that!
I know!	Well what Yknow what Im gonna do? Im gonna go over there; Im gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!
Look, Chandler I dont think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!	Youre right.
Yeah!	Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) Im gonna get the ring! Im gonna get the ring! (Does so) Im gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) Im just going to propose!
Okay.	Okay great.
Dude-dude-dude!	What?!
Chandler.	Where is she? Im not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)
Shes not here and please come in.	(examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, she was here, but she left.	Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.	Oh my God, I cant believe this! Yknow, I thoughtI thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.	Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnt tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?	Yknow what? I cant believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well Im sorry.	And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently Im willing to offer her things that you are not.	But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, shed be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.	It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isnt fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because
You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)	Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?
No I dont have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, dont let her go. Trust me.	Yknow Richardyou are a good guy.
Dude!	I cant talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
Shes gone.	What?
Shes gone. She had a bag and she left.	What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.	Well why didnt you stop her?! Why didnt you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnt believe me.	Well where Where did she go?
To her parents I think and she said you shouldnt call her. But if I were you I would.	I cant believe I ruined this.
You wanted it to be a surprise.	Oh my God.
Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a reason why girls dont do this!	Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay!

Dont worry about that man, that happens.	Its happened to you?
Yeah! Once.	Well, whatd you do?

You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!	Yes, you can pass for 19.
Really?	Yes!
Seriously?	Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.	Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?	We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).
Keep talking.	Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!
(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.	Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.
(in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.	Its Paris, who knows were here!
Yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.	Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
Maybe just 10 minutes for you.	Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!
Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?	What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.	(entering) Ahh, third base.
Uh, Rachel, Ive been thinking. I dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. Im calling it off.	(To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.
(yelling after them) I cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!	Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)
I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Im going to announce that Im pregn	How is that ever going to happen?!
Look, I am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that	(To Ross) I dont care, she slept with me.
(deadpan) Well, Im going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.	Thanks.

Oh thank you.	Okay. (Goes back to bed.)

Okay! (Runs off.)	(incredulous) Already?!
Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music	Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
(returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3 3-ring binder on the table.)	What in Gods name is that?!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.	Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt plan anymore and Derrick (Off of Rachel and Monicas looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know.
(sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Yknow, something a little snugglyer?	Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!	Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!	Okay.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?	Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies? (Holds up a picture of each.)	Definitely roses. (Monica and Rachel exchange a look.) Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy. (Monica holds the Lily picture closer to him.) But Lilies are the clear choice.
Oh my God! Its like one mind.	Uh-huh!
Geller: So Chandler, youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.	Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.	Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story.
Geller: (incredulous) You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!	What a sweet story.
Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever propose!	Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)
I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.
Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!	Honey, its gonna be okay.
No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can we	Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.
How? I dont have any money.	Well, I have some.
How much?	Well, close to (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)
(starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.	Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
and Monica: Ah, yeah!	Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
This is the most special day of our lives.	No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna	Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-youre gonna have to put your foot down?	Yes, I am!
Hey.	Hey.
Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.	Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.	Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!	Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.
Oh, youre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?	Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
You thought about that?	Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?	Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?	Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we c
(laughs) Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding.	Sure you do.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.	You sure?
Uh-hmm.	I love you so much.
I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.	Oh yeah, totally!
	Hey, you guys!
and Rachel: Hey!	So, what do you think?
What?	Are you kidding? Okay, Ill give you a hint; Ill give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)
Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlers eyes!	I got glasses!
Well, you-youve always had glasses.	No I didnt!
Yes!	No!
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.	Really?
Yeah!	(sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didnt think I used to wear glasses, right?
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?	Thats okay Pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us
Hey, I know I what I want!	What we want honey.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?	Dying people say the craziest things.
Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies.	Our kids are gonna be fat arent they.
(entering) Ahoy!	Hey! Hows the boat?!
Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)	Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.
What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.	Do you know what I was thinkin?
What?	Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)
(entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?	Uh why, do you have a lecture?
No, why?	Then free as a bird. Whats up?
Yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.	Well, did-did you correct him?
He hates to lose.	Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand.
Youre not a lefty?	Does anybody know me?!
Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?	Dont worry about it Pheebs.
Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)	An old cookie?
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.	We cant accept this.
Why not?	Cause its gross.
Yeah! I bet I can do it.	Okay, we owe you a present.
Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand	I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?	Daddy. All right look, heres the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. 
And what did he ask you not to call him?	Guys?
Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it!	I know.
You gave my father a lap dance!	Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.	Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
Come on, its not that big a deal!	Not that big a deal? Therethere was touching of things.
Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!	I dont want him to tell this story for years.
You were trying to eat it!	If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
(takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) Im sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Ill call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)	(getting up) All right, Im off to see your dad.
(laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.	Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass. (Exits.
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) youre burning in hell!!	So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a littleIm a little embarrassed about it.
Geller: I understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father as	What did you do when they found out?
Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?	So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
(on phone) Hello? (Listens) Hold on please. Joey, its your mom. (Hands him the phone.)	Its your mommy. Its your mommy.
It wasnt the best.	That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Oh no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him.	And say nothing?
Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) Im sorry, its for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?	No-no-no-no. (Waves him away as Monica and Phoebe enter whispering to each other.) Hey! (Monica shushes him.)
(To Chandler) Hey sweetie.	Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I cant tell you. Its a secret.	Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.	No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.
Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?	Oh no-no, I cant do that.
If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said.	Okay.
Okay.	So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, w
Oh my God. He threw up?	No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebes secret?
Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting fired.	Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Chandler, you have an assistant right?	(angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
No, I-I just dont know how you decide who to hire. I mean Ive got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then theres this guy	What about him?
Okay youre right. Ill hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!	Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.	Hey.
Hey! Good, youre home!	Oh its always nicer to here than, Aw crap! You again!
Hey baby. (Kisses him.)	Hey.
I made you a surprise.	Oh yeah?
Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such a craving for them.	Did you not understand the story?
(entering) Hey!	Hey! Whats up?
Oh, nothin much. Just trying to figure out what Im gonna do for dinner.	Huh.
(notices the table) HeyOoh! Whats-whats that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?	No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!
(To Chandler) You told her!	Nancy Thompsons getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)
(To Chandler) How could you tell her?!	I had too okay?! Were getting married! Married couples cant keep secrets from one another!
Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.	Du-ude!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar	Did you not hear me say, Du-ude?!
(To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.	In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard	Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!	You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!
All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!	Ross came in forth and cried!
Its hard for some people!	(To Monica) Of course it is. (Mouths to Ross) Wowwhoa!
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!	Hey!!!
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!	That was you!
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!	(To Monica) You have no trouble telling time now right?
No!	Quick! What time is it?! (Holds his watch in front of her face.)
I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?! (Ross laughs.) What are you laughing at Pampers? (He stops laughing and glares at her.)	Yknow when I said that because were getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?	Yeah that was stupid. Lets not do that.
Man! (Monica mouths, Im sorry.)	Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnt hang out withall the guys in my office.
	Hey.
Whats the matter?	Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
Oh Willies still alive!	What are you guys doing?
Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us.	Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist.
Thats not true, there are great pictures of us!	No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this (Makes what can only be described as a toothy frown. Henceforth, this shall be known as The Face.)
Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the Statue of Liberty.	I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture.
(looking at one) Oh, heres a great one.	Yeah, Im not in that.
Chandler what do you say?	All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going. (Does The Face while saying that last part.)
(To Chandler) Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh	How about those three pointers?
Amazing!	And those guys were this (Doing the standard This Close gesture) close to lettin us play this time too.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.	Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!	They have that on the napkins at the club.
Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.	Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yknow you cant date him right?
Maybe I should open a divorced mens club.	Dude that is so sad.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.	Could I play?
Photographer: (taking pictures) Great! Thats great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?	Okay. (Does The Face.)
Photographer: Im sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?	No, I am.
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.	I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)
Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.	Okay. (Youll have to see it, I cant describe the face he makes, but it isnt good.)
I know. Lets try a lookof far offwonderment. Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come. (Chandler is still not getting it.) Chandler! What is the matt	Aww! (Smiles.)
They cant all be bad. (To Chandler) Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.	Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
See? Thats a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. (Chandler immediately does The Face.) Youre changing it!	I cant help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?	Borrow money from me?
Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down (Looks down), look down, keep looking down; then I look up. (Looks up and smiles.) See? All right, now you try. Look down (Ch	Why is there jelly on your shoe?
Hey!	Hey!
Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow, thats why I never had any luck with Chandler.	(Pause) Im right here!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!	Im still right here!
I know, Monica told me.	Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
Yeah. Sure. (Joey nods his head questioningly and Rachel nods no.)	Can you people not see me?! (He waves his arms around to get their attention.)
(seeing him approach) Hey! There you are!	There I am!
Are you okay?	Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!	Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?	I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I know how to take a picture now. (They get ready) Okay, see? Look down (Looks down), look down, look down (He falls asleep.)
Chandler?	(awakens) Yeah! (Looks up and does The Face.)
Ooh, lets see it!	Ahhh.
Okay. (She opens it up and shows it to them.)	Oh yeah, that looks good.
Yeah, we really do!	Okay.
Yknow, we dont have to imagine.	Im marrying her.
Credits	Die Hard still great!
Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?	Whatd you rent?
Die Hard 2.	(looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Dude, you didnt say Die Hard. Is everything okay?	Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Well, John McLane had plans!	No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheshe wished me good luck.	Thats sweet.
No, its more like a (sarcastically) good luck.	So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.	Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?	No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
What are you doing?	Well, lets see (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)
Oh my God yes! Who is she?	Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?	(pause) No, were still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?	Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow
Fat?!	I did not say fat! I said, Fa-aa-aw-ow
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!	Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.	Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!	Can you figure out what Im doing?
Youre Lewis Posin.	Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?	Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think t	What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.	Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
And shes back in the game.	(she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.	(To Monica) Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Its pretty clear.	Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Thats why you broke up with me?	You-you-you didnt know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!
No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill be.	As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.	I would really love it if could do both.
All right, II have to ask.	What?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?	What?!
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?	A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not the point.	Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.	Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
How?	You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are!	Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And 
Keep going.	So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?	Id carry you around in my pocket.
I love you. (They hug and kiss.)	Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies.
Credits	Come on! Why are we here?!
Okay, okay take a guess.	The hot chicks?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, yknow-yknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! Its here! Yeah, its right-its right down he	Wow thats actually pretty cool.
(stopping quickly) Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?	Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Student: Sorry!	You didnt bring me here to do that, did you?
So, whos the lucky guy?	OHMYGAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnt tell her we were getting married, did you?
Well, she saw the ring.	Did she freak out?
Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.	Right.
Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.	(laughs) You said no right?
Huh?	You said no right?!
Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!	Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checks in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I cant wait to read your book Ross!!
Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad.	What do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? You dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!	Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what? Shes probably not gonna even want to come.
Really?	No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
So-so you wouldve just lied?	Yes!!
Would it really have been that easy?	Yes!!!
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?	Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure why were having it.
What are we gonna do?	I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Chandler?	(To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Please, its because otherwise I really dont know what I might do.	Arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
Well justwell just let her stay.	No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Kinda like your Barca lounger.	Is that what youre thinking about right now?
Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.	Janice, Im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.
Why not?	Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
He does?	Say again?
Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cant stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.	Feelings, such strong feelings.
(to the guard) Dont sweat it, Ive got this section covered. Yeah, in fact Ive got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in peoples eye(The guard walks away)Okay, see you later.	I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
(entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!	No, no, no. No-no-no.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?	No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's like insanely easy!	Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).
Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thats true in so many ways, trust me, Ive lived in one and been to the other.)	Oh, okay, time's up!
All right, I got 48.	Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?
Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.	Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead invegetables, Joey?
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!	Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.
Done! With time a-to-spare.	Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)
You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful thing	Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)
All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!	I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!
No, just give me another minute.	Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.	Okay, but if you can'tno dinner!
Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)	Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?	I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie!	Which smells delicious!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!	What?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!	Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
Ohio!! Thank you!	Huh! Where is the dog?!
There's no dog in here.	Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!
No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.	What is it doing here?
Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!	Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days	(gasping) Really?
Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?	Well, it still has to go, right?
and Phoebe: Why?	Okay, it's um
Don't do what?	(to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, Do what you have to do) Okay, I hate dogs.
Don't do what?	What?
Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)	They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?	(scared) Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies?	(to Tag) Okay, you are new!
It's too cold.	Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
(to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.	And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!
Where's Chandler?	(comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!	How did youknow? (Heads back into the bathroom)
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)	(comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.	Why not?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.	Well, I, I should go in there.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.	Why not?
Because you sent away the dog!	This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)
(entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?	Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.	Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.	And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)
(opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?	No, no he went for a walk.
Hi, honey.	Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
(interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.	Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yknow, for you, and(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, i
(uncovers the dog) Hi!	Clunkers?! Oh my god!
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!	(to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.	It's up to you.
Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!	All right.
(hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!	You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.
(pauses) I know.	Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
Uh-huh!	Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours. (Ross pushes him off.)	Okay. Okay.
Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, whit	That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
Credits	Hey! What are you guys doing?
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.	Im sorry, who?
Im gonna hang this basket (Points to the one sitting on the table) on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.	But we dont know the neighbors.
See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.	Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved?
(entering, happily) Gooood morning!!	Eh, somebodys in a good mood!
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!	Well, either that or uh(Motions towards Joeys door.)
(starts to leave, but stops) Oh and Chandlers about to cry.	(about to cry) Am not!
(turning a light on) Who is that?!	Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! II am brave! (They get to the door and Monica goes to open it.) No-no-no-no!! (He stops her.) (Through the door.) Can you tell me who is there please?
Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.	(laughs) 4:00 A.M.
So, can I get some candy?	I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
(looking at Monica.) Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you!	Mm! Night Gar! (Monica closes the door.)
Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!	Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Oh hi!	Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!	(with his mouth full) What happened? Im just eating candy.
Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way I meant it.	Absolutely! Yknow, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
Oh my God! Joey!	What is the matter with you?
(watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?	Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
(closing the door) Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work!	Yknow what would work?
Hmm?	Stop making candy!
But they like it!	You mean they like you.
Maybe.	Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
(looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)	(asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on?
Yeah lady! Give us candy!!	Joey!
Whats up buddy?	What are you doing?
Waiting for candy.	Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for hi
(opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!	We want candy! We want candy now! (And other general commotion sounds.)
(opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!	All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! (They settle down) What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making c
Man: (from earlier) Candy Lady?	No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
(stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!	All right, yknow what? Forget it, all of you forget it! Youve ruined it! Go home! Youve ruined it! Youve ruined it!
(To Chandler) Thank you.	Youre welcome. (They kiss.)
Did you smoke?	No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uhare you okay?
	Buh-bye. (Hangs up the phone) I just got us reservations at Michelles and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.
Betrothed (Corrects him)	betrothed couple.
(entering carrying a skull) Hey!	Hey!
Haaaa... (Puts the skull on the table) ... ahhhh!	Pheebs?
Huh?	Skull?
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
(Thinking it over) Sure! (Takes one) Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.	Ohh! That's great!
No.	How long have we been home?
About a half an hour.	Lovely!
Credits	Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?
No.	Why not?
(entering) Oh, hey, you guys!	Hey!
Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.	Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
Yeah, why not?	Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.
Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?	No reason, exceptshetoldme.
Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore?	No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.
Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. (Chandler and Monica look surprised) Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, Your mom probably won't kill herself, yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm	Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
(yelling) No! Drums!	(to the Maitre d') Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please? (Laughs.)
d': Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.	Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
d': I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.	Is this because of the burrito thing?
(pulling Chandler away from the Maitre d') You need to give him money.	Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.	Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.	Hey, I can be smooth. (Walks back to the Maitre d', very smoothly) Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it. (Shakes his hand)
d': Of course, sir.	Okay. (Walks back to Monica)
How did it go?	Had the money in the wrong hand. (Shows her his left hand with the money in it)
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!	How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.	Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.	Mustached bastard
(sees two people exit) Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!	(walks up to the Maitre d') Excuse me...
Guest: (to the Maitre d') Good evening. (Shakes his hand)	(finds his money) Ahh-hahaha! (Turns around to give the Maitre d' his money, but he isn't there anymore)
Here you go.	Thank you Gunther, put it there. (He gets up, and shakes Gunther's hand. A bunch of coins fall out his hand. He sits down next to Monica.) Definitely not easier with coins. (Joey gets up and picks up 
Here. (Gives her the coins) Now I only owe you $49.50.	Hey Pheebs!
Hey! (she sits down next to him)	If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...	(entering in a Santa costume) Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Santa! (Runs to Chandler and hugs him)	Hey! (Grunts as Ben hits him at full speed.)
What are you doing here, Santa?	Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdturtle-man?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?	What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?	You bet I did, Ben, put it there! (He shakes Ben's hand, but the money falls out of his hands) (to Monica) Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! (Realizes, that Ben
(to Chandler) What are you doing?	You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.	Why?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it.	But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.	Fine, I'll give the suit back.
(to Chandler) Hey, you think, you can keep it another night? (She has a really teasing look on her face and keeps twirling Chandler's beard.)	Santa? Really?
Yes, is that okay?	Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.	Then it's okay! (They kiss.)
No! Why does he have to go?	Because, if Santa and the HolidayArmadillo? (Ross nods) ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.	Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
Yeah?	My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt. (Glaring at Joey whos nodding.)
	Ohh. Mmm.
(Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.	Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I(Chandler puts a forkful of the cheesecake in her mouth.)Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you ge	(nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.	Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
Why, why not?	Because it's too delicious.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.	No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, (Reading the label) Mommas Litt
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Yknow Im in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead.	So
Okay. (Joey exits.)	Oh, whats at 8:00?
My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!	Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends.
Yknow, she tried to undress me too.	I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then sushes him.)
Hi!	Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?	I cant seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?	Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling (Pause) Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!	(closing the box) Yknow what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.	Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
(laughs) Well see.	Well, thank you for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid!	So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. (Rachel laughs then Chandler notices something.) Do you see what I see?
(gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman is still lying in front of her door.)	Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.	By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.	Well, we dont want that.
No so were protecting her.	But we should take it.
But we should move quick.	Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.	Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake and they take off upstairs.)
(taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!	Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.
Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some? (He makes a disgusted noise and heads for his room, Chandler follows him in.)	What are you doing tonight?
Huh? Uh (He starts taking off his pants.)	Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
Oh! (Pulls up his pants.) Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?	Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
What?! Tonight?!	Thats what Monica said.
Oh, youre such a gentleman. (Grabs his arm.) Come on! Were going to my place! (Drags him off to her place.)	Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
(with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)	I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the l	Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and Im takin it back! (Grabs the cheesecake and heads for his apartment.)
What?! What?!	Oh yes!
Wait a minute!	Oh yes!
Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont!	Oh yes! Oh yes!
You think I trust you with it?! No! Were gonna split it! You take half and I take half!	Well thats not fair, youve already had some!
What? Oh, well then yknow what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.	What do we use to split it?
Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.	(examining the cake) Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!	All right, Ill pick that one. (Points.)
Thats also the smaller piece. (Puts the piece onto a plate.) Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and dont come crying to me if you eat your piece t	(gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.	Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my (Rachel knocks the plate from 
Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!	Stick to your side!
Well, technically it seven billion years ago (Well, technically youd be able to see it for days, well nights; that is if you could see it with all of the bright lights of New York.)	(groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up a leave.)
Okay! Okay! Fine, Ill stop! No teaching, okay? Well just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky. (Comets dont streak across the sky, meteors do.) Okay? Whos official name is Bapstein-King.	Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)
(looking up) There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Nature amazing?	(looking up with her) Thats a plane!
Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly. (She walks over to where Chandler is bundled up in a big coat and shiverin	(with a quivering voice) No, Im not!
Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket?	Because its flattering! (Shivers harder) Come on Monica! Come on Monica! (He goes inside.)
(covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)	(whispering) Monica!
Shes sleeping.	I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up.	Sorry, I justcant sleep. Ooh! (Turns on the light and Monica groans.) Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers o
It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.	What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
(To Joey) I know, I wasnt finished. (Joey motions him to finish.) (Yelling at the street) But dont worry! Were gonna go down the fire escape!!	Shhhhhhhhh!!! (Monica enters) Im sorry, I thought maybe Id make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok? (Chandlers holding a wok.) I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.	It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway.	Hey, yknow what we can do? Yknow, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were first going out. Itd be fun!
Okay that does sound like fun.	Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
The second sister dies?!	(Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?	Thats correct.
Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about? (She sees that Chandler has fallen asleep and slams the door loudly to wake him up.)	(startled) What? What? What?
Are you still awake?	Yeah! You?
You do know that was me who just said that right? (He doesnt respond and she turns on the light, waking him.) Hey. As long as were both up	(intrigued) Yeah? (Monica nods yes.) I hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room.
What?! What are you doing?!	Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.	No. We were in the middle of sexand you fell asleep.
Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world! (She turns out the light to go back to sleep.)	(turning the light back on) Monica?
What?!	I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay. Okay, Im ready. Come on big fella!	Okay.
Give me the good stuff.	Yeah! (Monica falls asleep) No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. (Monica doesnt move as he gets out of bed and as hes heading for the door.) And I probably wont spil
That really was some of your best work.	Hm-hmm, I told you! (Looks at the clock) I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.	Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!	Do you wanna?
Hey, yknow whats weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, This is my brother-in-law Ross. Not, My friend Ross, brother-in-law Ross. Thats weird isnt 	Couldnt I just say, This is Ross?
(on phone) Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper! (Listens) Yes were surprised! (Listens) Who did you leave a message with?	(knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?	Joey! Joe! (Sees that hes not here and starts investigating. He picks up the bag of chips.) Full bag. (He picks up the beer.) Beers still cold. Something terrible mustve happened here! (He decides its

Hey Chandler!	Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?	Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?	(excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000. (Which is an actual product by the way, Im not sure about the 3000 part.)	Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?!
Well, its a long story, but umm I broke Joeys chair	Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair?
Yeah.	I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhhhh. Thats how it got fixed!	Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Noo! (Laughs) Angels.	Im gettin my chair back! (Heads for Joey and Rachels.)
Well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now! (Sits down in it and groans.)	Joey you broke my chair!!
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap! (Joey starts to get up.) No I take that back!	I think I should get the chair!
How do you figure?	Because you (Points to Joey) broke a chair and you (Points to Rachel) broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!
No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere.	Well, wheres the logic in that?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!	So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Thats right!	What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Happy birthday!!!	Rach! Come on! Rach!
(entering from her room) Hey.	(To Monica) Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?	No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun.
Yeah, but you shouldnt compare yourself to me.	Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!	Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
Werent you asked to leave sonny?	(To Joey) Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any minute!
But it hurts my Joeys Apple.	(frustrated) Okay, for the last time. Its not named for each individual man.
Geller: (To Chandler) Youve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.	Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I cant believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! (To Mr. Geller) And you! I cant believe that you would have a tux thats thirty years old! (Puts hi
Geller: Its older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.	Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
(entering) Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming!	Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the assemblage.)
Geller: Crap.	(getting up to investigate) Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out whats going on.
Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)	Hey-hey are you drunk?
Nooo! (Giggles) Okay. (She tries to pull herself up by Rachel and Joeys doorknob, but the door opens and she almost falls into the their apartment. She manages to catch herself.) Whoa! (Stands up, uns	Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Noo!!!	Yes!
Noo!!	Yes!!
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.	Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.
Really?! You promise?	Yeah, Ill take care of it.
Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)	(laughing) Okay we have to do something about your breath.
What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)	Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.
Okay. I can do that.	Okay.
Okay. I can do that.	Surprise!!!
Right, okay, then no.	Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.
Yay!	See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller whos sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller whos standing next to him.)
(sees someone) Paul!	(correcting her) Phil.
Phil!	Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre doing fine.
Hey, whats going on?	Monicas a little drunk.
Awwwww (Giggles.)	(To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesnt want her parents to know shes drunk.
Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed!	Monicas wasted.
Maybe that will liven up this party.	(To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)	Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?	For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!
Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! Its better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Ch	No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
(crying) No, I know! I get it! Its funny!	No, because youre not a grandmother!
(To Monica) Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.	(to a waiter) Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.
(to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?	(To Monica) How are you feeling?
I really wish that you wouldnt.	(To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone.
(clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh?	Pheebs!!
Come on!	Come on! Speech!
Geller: Oh-ho, I think its nice.	I think its necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)
Oh man!	What?
(interrupting her) Lift!! And slide!	Okay, here we go.
Yeah, Im sorry. (They hug.)	Hey! Howd it go?
(entering, limping, and holding his arm) I dont like this anymore. (He sits down with them in pain.)	Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.
Yeah, its just yknow	(To Ross) Monica said wedding.
Oh! I would love to read a poem.	Do you think you could get through a poem?
Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.	Too?
Sorry, Im kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.	Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type manner.)
(entering, excited) Hey!	Hey!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!	Oh!!
Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, youre not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!	Thats great!
And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!!	So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
Wouldnt you love to do it just once?! (Raises her hand towards Chandler.)	Dont do it.
What is that?	I think its the dying cat parade.
It sounds like its coming from across the street.	(turning around and looking) Oh my God!
What?	Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, Youre half Scottish right?
Nooo!!	Yes!!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!	Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! Its not even a song!	If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
(shocked) I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my resume!	Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.	Oh no thanks. I dont like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
What?!	Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland byVikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories. (Makes a few unintelligible noises.)
How did you know about that?!	We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Were you the ones called the cops?!	Thats not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Why not?	Because we hate them.
Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play!	We have heard you play.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.	You mean the spitter?
Come on! It wasnt that bad!	Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.
All right, what about the third guy?	You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?	Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say, I do, hes thinking, Yeah, Id do her too!
Well then we still have a problem.	Yeah!
What?! No! It was my idea!	Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!	We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?	No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Well then let me do it!	Joe
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would r	(To Monica) Yknow, we havent found anybody else.
So I can do it?	Yeah you can do it.
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?	Yeah.
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)	Hey!
Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!	Our minister
Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?	Okay.
Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler 	(To Monica) Should we call the spitter?
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?	Yeah. O-okay.
Yes!	See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories abo
Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?	No, not us (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!	See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic stories. Nice stories.
by doin it.	Joe?
Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together and shes feeding you strawberries?	Isnt that what happened with you and the brides maid?
Yeah baby!	And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
Oh.	But then later that night
Yeah baby!	(answering the door) Hey!
(standing outside) Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up here in London huh?	Well I was I was exactly expecting company after(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.
(entering) Is Joey here?	Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brides maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?
Wouldnt you be?	Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and youve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
Really?	You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
Well, not anymore.	But we dont do that.
I know, I just thought it would be fun.	How drunk are you?
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.	(thinks) Thats the perfect amount!
(breaking the kiss) Yknow whats weird?	What?
This doesnt feel weird!	I know.
Youre a really good kisser.	Well, I have kissed over four women. (They kiss again.) Do you wanna get under the covers?
Hm-hmm!	Okay!
Wow! You are really fast!	It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
Were gonna see each other naked.	Yep!
Do you wanna do it at the same time?	Count of three?
One!	Two!
and Chandler: Three! (They lift up the covers and check each other out, then come back up with silly grins on their faces.)	Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we werent that close anyway!	Eh!
Eh, we werent that close anyway!	Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey! (Monica hides under the covers as Joey enters. Remember?)
Hey!	Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e (Notices that the TV is turned off.)
Oh, dude Im so sorry!	No! No! No!
Hey no-no-no-no! Its cool! Its cool! I-Ill only be a second, Im still with my brides maid, I justWhere are those condoms you brought?	Theyre in my bag over there. (Points.)
Ah. (Joey walks to Chandlers bag by getting as far away from Chandlers bed as possible.)	Uh, could you leave me one?
(pause) For just you?	Yeah.
Hey listen, why dont you come downstairs with me? Theres some really nice girls down there.	No I-I-Im fine.
What?!	What?
(To Joey) What?!	Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Break	(To Monica) So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?
No because it-it didnt seem important.	Oh, its not important? Its not important?! If it wasnt for a brides maid youd be marrying him (Points to Joey) not me!
And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv(Shuts up on Monicas glare.)	I dont believe it. The most romantic night of my life and Im runner up.
Hey! (Monica turns and looks at him) Now Im a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!	(To Joey) Look there is no way youre doing this wedding now. Okay?
What?! Thats not fair! Its not my fault! I was off with my brides maid! And whos to say I wouldve even said yes?! (To Monica) I mean I wouldve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a d	Okay, its just weird! Okay? I dont want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needI dont know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait Chandler come on, letsits not a big deal!	It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. (Walks out and slams the door.)
Hey.	Hey. Do you want this scone? (Holds up his plate) It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!	Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding
No-hey-no! If you dont want me to do it, I except that. I dont care about that. I justI dont want you to be upset.	How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! Youre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have work	Thats what you should say.
What?	When youre marrying us; thats what you should say.
Really? I can do it?	Id love it if you would do it.
Hey! (They hug.)	But those are the words! Those exact words!
So are guys doing okay?	Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Food? Uh-huh gimme! (She hands him the paper.)	So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that were trying to get to play at the wedding?
Since when are you into swing music?	Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
Chandler.	Gap commercial. (To Monica) So did you book them? Did you call?
I will.	Do you want me to call?
What is your job?	Staying out of the way.
(noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! Shes cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?	Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged. Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Yknow actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and	(To Ross) Smooth.
NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)	So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying shed like to go out again.	Huh.
(entering) Hey Chandler!	Hey!
Listen, sorry I didnt stop by last night but I had a date.	Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and you dont come by? Thats okay!
Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!	Really? Right across the street?
Yeah!	Whend you meet her?
Two days ago.	Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too!
(returning) Hey.	Hi! Howd it go?
Oh great! Were going out again Saturday. But I just found shes also seeing some other guy.	(sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Rosss situation?
Well you shouldnt be. Believe me I wouldnt want to be the guy whos up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!	So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, whats the name the girl youre dating?
and Ross: Kristen Lang.	Bye! (Exits.)
Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).	Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)
Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work.	(returning) What are you guys talking about?
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now Im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why 	But I love swing music!
Yeah but the Swing Kings? Yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsThey just stop living.	Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And theres another reason too.
Well, what is the other reason?	I dont want to say.
Well you have to because maybe its stupid.	Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasthe first time I knew thatyou were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Probably around gonorrhea.	Hi, honey! Im home!
(from the bedroom) Dont come in here!	Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
No! We only mess around at his place!	Yknow its funny I started it but, now its scary me. So could you come out here please?
No, Im wearing a wedding dress.	Oh you got a wedding dress? Thats great!
Yeah but Im not keeping it.	Well then why cant I see it?
Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you cant like it.	Okay I promise. Ill-Ill hate it. (She enters.) Wow! You-you lookhideous.
Really?	Yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress Ive ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
Oh because it doesntreally fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.	Oh thats great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean its like yuck! Its terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
Okay! But you cant rip it. Well, maybe a little.	Okay!
(entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?	(without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
See? Thats what I mean. I mean that, thats great! But I wouldnt trade in what I have for that. I mean Im gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy. (Chandler approa	Oh totally! (Holds up his finger.) Pull my finger.
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?	Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
Youre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?	Kinda. Theyre really big.
Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again?	What?
Just, I love you so much. JustIts just sometimes it bothers me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush?	No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?	Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and Im afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?	I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. (Monica laughs.) Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?	Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts, Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Come here! Come here! (They hug.) Sweetie you dont have to worry. No, besides yknow what? Im gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid	(hoarsely) Water! Water! Water!
I dont know. (Timidly) A cowboy theme?	Hey!
Hey!	Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy me too!	Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
Yeah?	Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!	Thats me! Come on!
Okay. (They both jump up to head for there room, but Monica stops.) But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.	Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.	(transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
(catching him) Chandler!	Ill be right with you.
What?! Chandler shes our cousin!	I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch. (Stares at Monicas eyes.) Say something.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.	Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
(To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.	This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Well-wellsee? Parents are comin!	Yknow I think we should invite them.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.	Well this is just sad!
(motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a few) But these are the three that Monica pr	Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me!	(sees another rack) Well, whats the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when theyre done with them they just send em back.	You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.	You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?	Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
Umm, well lets see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.	Not bad.
(reading a tag) This one is uh Paul ONeil.	Whos that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!	Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.	Are you serious?
Yeah.	007?! This is James Bonds tux?!
Yeah.	Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux!
Its a pretty cool tux.	Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)	A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!	What?
Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.	You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
So?	SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.	Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.	Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
When I got married you slept with my sister.	That was pretty 007.
Break	Ross is Batman!
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.	Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!	Batman has a utility belt!
007 has a fancy car!	Batman has the Batmobile!
007 gets all the ladies.	Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice martini.	Actually, I dont like martinis.
How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?	Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why dont we put them on? Yknow get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.	I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.	Well, does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours?
What are you kidding? Its Batmans tux!!	(standing up) Let me try it on!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin in there.	(trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) Whats this?
What?	An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!	The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
(defeated) Oh.	Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really glad theyre coming.
Credits	(yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
Well yknow what they say, the 23rd times the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!	Whose is it?
Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.	Whose is it?
I dont want to say.	Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?
Do you realize that four weeks from today were getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!	Do you realize you get louder each week?
Theres still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?	I figured Id buy those. Pat, Id like to buy a vow. (Laughs)
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.	Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
No! But I know exactly what Im going to say.	Do you happen to know what Im going to say?
(handing him a pad of paper and a pen) Lets just do it right now. Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart. (She goes back, sits down, and starts feverishly writing.)	(watching in her) (in his head) Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door.
Credits	(writing) Monica, there are no words (To Joey and Ross) There are no words! This should not be this hard!
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.	Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Well, why dont you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.	Yeah, Im not sure I can do that.
Monica: Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.	(seeing her) Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.	All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out theres more than three), five, six, and seven!	(shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) Thats one?
Its kind of an important one!	Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, Monica	(writing) Monica
when I look back over our time together	(writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?	You'll get one.
Oh yeah? When?	All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?	Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?	No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?	(trapped) Uh, uh.
Well?	Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)
(Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)	Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)	Look, Monica
Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)	This is not going to work.
I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)	You are so great! I love you!
What?	Nothing! I said, I said You're so great and then I just, I just stopped talking!
You said you loved me! I can't believe this!	No I didn't!
Yes, you did!	No I didn't!
You love me!	No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You love me!	Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.	Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense.	Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying?
You wanted it to be a surprise.	Oh my God.
Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As tofall in love with my bestmy best Theres a reason why girls dont do this!	Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. 
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!	I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?	Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.	Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.	Hey Joe!
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.	Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)Diet Coke.
How?! When?!	It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!	The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!	No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
(on phone) I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.	(on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Bye!	Bye!
Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)	(after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
Actually, I did!	Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!	Phoebe knows about us!
Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So	Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
I couldn't even if I wanted too.	Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
She's bluffing!	Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!	Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Of course.	Oh, you're-you're going?
Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.	(swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.	Not if I kiss you first.
Ooh.	Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes. Our first kiss.	Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
And why not?!	Because I'm in love with Monica!!
You're-you're what?!	Love her! That's right, ILOVEHER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.	Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?	Who are those people?
Hey.	Whats going on?
Oh thats so sweet.	So we both finished our vows.
Chandler!!	Dont worry honey, well make yours funnier.
Credits	Okay, what do you guys think?
(starting to cry) I have never known love like this.	You really like it?
Dude! How-how did you write this?	I stole Monicas and changed the name.
Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.	Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding.	I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not the close. I havent seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!	Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.	Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
Here! (She sets a bag down in front of him.)	Whats this?
Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas.	Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well save!! (Monica just looks at him.) Were not elopin
Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.	Yknow we already went over this and I won!
No you didnt. Oh and honey just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore.	Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see him. I dont wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know	No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a dif
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad.	He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Whos Mr. Girabaldi?	Does it matter?!
Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your weddingyoure gonna regret it for the rest of your life.	Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you.
Yes!	So I really never get to win anymore?
in Drag: (To Chandler) Hm-mmm?	Yeah, I just ordered a beer! (Pounds the table.)
I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.	No! No! I dont want him to know were yet! Im not sure Im ready for that. And besides hes not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Why not?!	I dont know if Ive told you this, but hes kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
What?!	Yeah, hes made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Yknow its all very Cats in the CradleI dont want to get into it. (The show starts.) 
Hello darlings.	And theres daddy!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and(She holds the mike out to the audience.)	Gay!
That cant be your father.	Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God!
What?	Thats Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
(singing) For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy! (Applause.) Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars. (He starts going into the audience	Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the audience.

Old?	The young hot ball and chain.
(To Chandler) Yknow what? Actually Im kinda glad theyre leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.	Whats up?

Bing: Chandler!	Mom. Thanks for wearing something. (They hug.) (Shes wearing a tight dress with a lot of cleavage showing.)
Bing: (entering) Hello all!	Hidad.
Bing: Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?	Oh my God! (He and Monica walk away.)
Daddad, please! As I was saying umm, Im Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and Im the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is	To the Bings!
So this is your office?	How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym!

Why not?!	Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cant be the Bings!
Whats wrong with being the Bings?	The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?	No.
Then you are neither of your parents!	Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And Ive met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make 
But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.	I want to. I love her so much, but Im afrIts too huge.
Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?	Well yeah, but then

Well you obviously didnt see Chucky 3.	But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so shed know I was okay.
Bing: Oh look at you! So handsome!	You look beautiful mom. (His dad clears his throat.) You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. (He kisses his dad on the cheek) Im so glad you here. (He kisses his mom.)
Rabbi: Are you Chandler?	Are you Joey?
Geller: I love you sweetheart. (He kisses her and they sit down.)	You look beautiful. Is this new? (Her dress.)
Not now.	Okay.
Rabbi: I am Father Kalebasous.	(in Monicas ear) Hes Greek Orthodox.
Chandler?	(To Ross) No, thats okay. (Ross nods and retreats.) Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how sim
You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?	I do.
We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. (To Chandler) Now kiss her again.	(To Monica) I love you. And I know about the baby.

I didnt take a pregnancy test.	Thenwho did?
Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnt. I did.	Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh. (He starts laughing, causing everyone else to laugh.)
Are you okay?	Hey Rach! (She breaks up and goes back into Monicas.)
Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.	What the fu(beep)ck are you doing?!
But audiencesYou have a live studio audience and they must love that. They must love it when they see you guys playing.	What are you guys doing?
Are you saying that you dont want to get with this?	You see, I dont say(Starts laughing.)
(spitting the cookie out onto a napkin) Oh, sweet Je(Beep)sus! Oh! Monica, these are the (laughing) cookies they serve in hell!	(noticing the woman on the screen) Whoa! Shes purty!
Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!	Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
It is when were able to crack each other up.	Monicas gotta have the phone in the right place and(Frantic babbling.)
We found your test in the trash, if youre not pregnant(She sees Rachel shaking her head)Its because I am.	What?! What are you talking about?
Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!	Whos the father?
Why?!	Why not?
Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.	As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin?
How about just the bridemaids?	Yknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!	Before we go out there Ive got a present for ya.
Honey, Im going to put my hand in your pocket!	No?
No.	Ive been taking dancing lessons.
What?!	Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
Oh that is so sweet!	So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Whats the matter?	I dont know, its these new shoes, theyre all slippery.
Well, are you going to be able to do this?	Not well.
Phillips: Congratulations.	Thank you.
Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.	Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Bing: Well, its a funny story.	Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be 	What size shoes do you wear?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.	Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Uh, I dont even really know where I left those. Sorry.	(looking at Joeys feet) Those arent eleven and a half.
Keep dancing.	And the world will never know.
Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?	Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
No-no! No! No! You dont tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Im a soap actor.	But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?	Did it turn into sand?
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)	(sliding up behind her) No. No, I wont. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Geller: Chandler, Im gonna have you arrested.	Why?
No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!	(to the front desk clerk) Hi! Were checking out of the bridal suite.
(depressed) Thats right. Im no longer a bride. Ill never be a bride again. Now, Im just someones wife!	And Im the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on dont be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!
Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)	We got the honeymoon.
Thats not til Thursday.	The wedding pictures?
They wont be ready for weeks.	Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
Thats true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!	Ill tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.
Okay.	What? What did you take a picture of?
Nothing! It was something.	Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?
Are you joking? Check out is not til noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.	Oh.
Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.	Okay, well Im gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youre 32! (Exits)
Hi.	Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Why not? Its built into the price of the room.	Yeah but you dont need(Picks up something)What is this?
Thread!	Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
What disposable cameras?	The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
No you didnt.	Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?	So you dont have the cameras?!
No. Sorry man.	So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak!
Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them.	Great.
Chandler?	Hey! Did you find the cameras?
No. Did you?	Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating.
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-ones turned them.	Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?	All my energy is going into not asking that question. I cant believe I screwed this up!
Im sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Heres a thought. This is the same ballroom. Theres a band. Theres gonna be plenty of dressed up people.	Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
No-no-no, Im saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elses faces.	Are you serious?
Im just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?	Marriage advice? Really?!
Im telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arent these the same flowers?	I dont know, Monica picked out the flowers.
What about the chairs?	She picked those out too.
How about the place settings?	That was her.
What did you do?	I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Break	(to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?
At The Wedding: Uh, would you take one of us?	Uhh Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!
At The Wedding: Why wont you take our picture?	Oh yeah. Ill take, Ill take your picture. (He takes the picture with his finger over the lens.)
At The Wedding: Uh, your finger was covering the lens.	Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
Hey Rach.	Why dont you go up on stage. Ill get a picture of you doing the speech.
Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)	Okay, you ready for the last picture?
Yeah.	Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.) Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and they both run out.)
There you go!	Were back!
Great! Were hangin in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Lets stay in the kitchen!	Its picture time.
Now you are going to love these.	(showing her the pictures) Heres a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thats me. (Another one.) And thats me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married coup
Wow! That is a great picture!	Eh?
Huh, didnt see that coming.	Okay, so this isnt a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withwith this lady. Which by the look on your face Im sure youll remember. So we dont need(Rips the picture)Theres no ne
That would be a good idea.	Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
You kissed another woman!	Call it even?!
	Hey! Babe! Arent you excited were going on our honeymoon?
Yeah I am!	(singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!	Id better go pack.
Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldnt find though was your Speedo.	A Speedo? Uh, I dont have a Speedo. Im gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Bye.	(entering) Hey, what was that all about?
Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.	(in a high pitched voice) What?! I didnt even know thatWhy didnt you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!
I didnt think you could keep it a secret.	(in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
What secrets?	Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
(whispering to Chandler) Youll tell me later?	You already know.
Theyre kissing lets just go around them.	Oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love.
(To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Lets act like were on our honeymoon.	We are on our honeymoon.
You see, if wed gone around them like I said, weShe wouldve given us those tickets. Damnit!	25J and K, any chance those arent together?
Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?	No.
Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)	Just act like you belong.
Oh my God! Oranges!	Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
Employee: Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?	Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
Employee: Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.	Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
Employee: (grabbing the ticket from him) Sir, this is not a first class ticket. Im sorry.	Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
I cant believe were here.	Oh youve got to be kidding me.
Who are you?	Were you just ten seconds later!
Well you can have the suite if you want. We dont care about where we stay. Were here to celebrate our love together. We dont have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.	(looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!	What else is new?
	Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I cant wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.
No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!	Theyre terrific, and they live right here in the city.
Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.	Im sorry, were just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.
Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck! (Angrily) Hi Greg, Im Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg.	Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance
Yknow what? Why dont you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?	We reallydidnt get a chance to

(hangs up) I dont think this numbers right!	What?
They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?	I dont know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
(voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.	Yeah, were gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)
Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)	I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong.
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.	I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
(rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)	Well maybe it was all of your questions.
What about my questions?	The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Oh, Im sorry. Was that another joke?	(angrily) Was that another question?
(on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rache	Did you do it on our invitations?!
(pause) Not on the ones we sent out.	So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)
You used the Europe story!	Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!

Franklin: Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.	You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
Franklin: Youre a joker Bing. (Walks away.)	Whats funny about that?

Yeah!	Again?!

Did that guy just call you Toby?	Yeah, he thinks thats my name.
Well, why dont you correct him?	Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say anything. And then the next time he said, Hey Toby, do you 
Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!	No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes 
(laughs) Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? (Ross realizes something.) Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? Its not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!	Shh! It is a family name!
Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all!	Hey Bob.

Franklin: Oh then you know each other.	Were on a semi-first name basis.
Franklin: What do you think of adding him to our team?	Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
Franklin: Really? They love him down on six.	But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
Franklin: Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.	I think its best sir.
Franklin: But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high. (Holds his hand at shoulder level.)	Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
Franklin: (laughs) Thats a good one. (Walks away.)	What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
Hey Toby, you got a sec?	Sure, whats up?
Hey Toby!	Hey Bobby.
Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bings office is?	Uhh yeah. Yeah, its (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you 
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.	Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here.

(To Chandler) That is so you!	When have I ever done that?!
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik? (They all look at him.) Well, Im a potato or aspud. And these are my antennae. (Points to the colander with an old TV antenna glued on top that hes wearing.) S	Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore!
Hey Mona!	Oh! Hi!
Hi!	Joeys gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youd come by as a slutty nurse.
Umm, actually Im just a nurse.	Youd think that would embarrass me, but you see Im maxed out.
Yes!	(To Ross) Marry her.
Sure.	Howdy doody.
Thats funny. Yeah. Yknow youre the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.	Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed.
(To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.	What question?
Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?	Theres no question.
So you think Ross too?	(To Monica) You picked Ross?!
Ross is really strong! Okay, hes the strongest out of all three of you! (Joey looks at her.) Except for Joey.	I cannot believe you didnt pick me.
Uh, in her defense, shes right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.	Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove it? (He pushes Ross who starts to fall backwards until Mona catches him.)
Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.	(To Ross) Youre going down.
(To Chandler) Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that	That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
Pride.	And dignity.
(To Chandler) So, you gettin tired?	Nope! I can do this all day.
Yeah? Me too. (Pause) Gettin a little tired though.	God, Im exhausted.
Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Monas standing right over there. (Looks behind him.) Oh God, shes talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!	No way! If anything youve gotta let me win! My wife thinks Im a wimp!
Hey, at least you have a wife! I-I keep getting divorces and knockin people up! And Im dressed as doody.	Youre Spudnik.
Come on, who are we kidding? Im doody. Please? Shes watchin.	Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no!
Look, I wanted to tell Im-Im sorry you lost.	Listen, Ive got a secret for ya. I let him win.

Hey.	Hey.

Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?	No, it wasnt you.
Well then who?	I got a maid. Yay!
(shocked) I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then	Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!	Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Did she really say that?	Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
Fine, I can do it. (Gets anxious.) Whew.	Whats the matter?
Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)	See? I told you.
She stole my jeans!	(pause) What?
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!	So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
Dont you see? Its the perfect crime!	She mustve been planning this for years!
I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that 	Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
I guess.	So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we gosnooping around her crotch?
Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient.	Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see. (Exits.)	(entering) Hi!
Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.	How come?
Because I put my head between her legs.	To see her pants?
Theyre my pants!	Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.	God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) Shes wearing my bra!	Oh dear God!
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!	And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy.
Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra!	Heres another planNo!
I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her!	Why?
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a team! Were in this together!	I fear a jury will see it the same way!
Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts all the time!	You see that?
Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a womans breasts.)	All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip.	You need new clothes.
(noticing him) What are you doing?	Im leaning. This is where I lean.
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.	Brenda a bee!
What?	Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
I think I know whats going on here.	You do?
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.	I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?
Oh my God!!! Monica!! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette party!!	Her what?!!
Your secret bachelorette party	You had a bachelorette party?!
She untied his G-string with her teeth. (Pause) Somebody stop me!	I thought we werent gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Yknow, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!	You went home with the waitress.
Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.	I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing! (She leaves.)	My God! You must be good in bed!
Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!	Shes okay with Rachel and the baby?
Well II havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow?	Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones.
(entering) Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party.	What?
Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!	Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a stripper
Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much better.	Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore.
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!	All right fine! But Im only doing this for you!
Yeah!	And Joey.
Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?	Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.	I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
So you uh, nervous about getting married?	What are you doing?
Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun.	Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day.
How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.	Youre right, this is more fun.
Hi!	Hi. (Joey blows on a noisemaker.)
Uh, that-thats-thats me!	Thats me.
So is that a bedroom? (Points to the guestroom.)	Yeah, yeah right over there.
All right, whenever youre ready. (She goes into the bedroom.)	That was weird.
Im waiting.	So shes a
Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.	I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do.	Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. (Walks towards the bedroom.) Maam, are you also a stripper?
Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny.	That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone.
Do you mind if I smoke in here?	Oh actually, Id rather youYeah, go ahead. Were gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.	Why would she do that?
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually?	This is the worst bachelor party ever!
In a minute!	(To Joey) In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.	Why me?!
Hey! Its your bachelor party.	Which is why you should do it.
I dont want to. You do it!	You do it!
You do it!	All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! (Joey smirks.) What?
I miss this.	I dont think weve actually done this before!
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.	Well wewe still hang out.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its likethings are different.	Well yknow, things are different. ImIm married now.
Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I justI misshanging outjust-just us, yknow?	Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on well make time to hang out with each other.
I swear I didnt know she was a hooker! I mean whDid you let her smoke in here?	Her ass print is still on your grandmothers quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Yknow what? Im gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper (turns on the radio), and youre gonna get a stripper. (She starts to strip.)	Monica! Wait!
What?	(puts on his crown) Carry on.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think Ill take them off. (Goes to do so.)	Could you not narrate?
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. (Monica exits.) (To Chandler) So hows the game?	I have no idea.
What?	Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont have to help out with stuff.
I dont believe you! That isbrilliant! And Monica has no idea?	Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Is your team winning hon?	Yeah! Anderson just scored again! (To Phoebe) Theres no Anderson.
Hey.	Oh hey. Id shake your hand but uh; Im really into the game. Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to each other.
Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit!	Im watching the game, but Im not deaf!
Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something? (St	(To Phoebe) Yknow, its been a while since weve screamed something. Maybe we should.
Oh okay.	Oh come on!
Okay, dinners ready!	Good game!
Yeah.	Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
(simultaneously) Green Bay.	(simultaneously) Detroit.
Everyone at our school heard it!	Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand.	Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
Hey! She didnt look 50!	Did she look 16?
She didnt photograph well!	Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!
Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.	Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Hey! So what do you think?	New haircut? (Monica nods No.) Necklace? (No) Dress? (No) Boots? (Monica nods Yes.) Boots!
Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend on bootsor rent (Shows him the receipt.)	Oh my God!
I know.	Im gonna miss being able to afford food.
Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, Oh, these are way too expensive for you.	She had a point. (Shows her the receipt.)
Theyre mine!	Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them.
Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautifu	I have you.
Hey guys!	Hey-hey.
See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already! Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants	You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. (Goes and gets some coffee at the counter.)
(entering) Hey!	(returning to his seat) Hey!
Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school	(spinning around looking for him) I dont think you did a very thorough job!
(standing up) Ahhhhhhhh!	(opening the door) Whats wrong?
Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning. (Mimics the groan from before and stretches.)	Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight. (They go into the apartment.)
Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we?	Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has asupple leather lining.
I-I dont-I dont think that Im gonna wear the boots tonight.	Why not?
Well yknow, Im just-Im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!	Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it.	You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on.	Okay.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.	Yknow, that party wasnt bad.
Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!	I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Oh no, we cant walk!	What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets go.
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?	Whats going on?
I cant walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!	What?
Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time!	So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. (Pause) Its oddly unsettling.
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?	Hop on.
Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. (She starts taking them off.) AhOohOohhOhhOh GodOhhOhOhhOhhhh	Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on.
The Police? Here? A reunion?! (She gets out her camera.)	Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
(notices something in the window) Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!	Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break?
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?	I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband.
Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.	(pause) I dont have your boots.
Well I dont have them either. Where are they?	Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Okay. (She gets off him.) God well, we gotta go back and get them!	Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get a chance to say goodbye.	Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Okay. (Climbs back on his back.) All right.	Okay. (Moves closer to the window.)
(laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)	Hey Pheebs, whats up?
You told me you hate massages!	Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningDont let Phoebe in.
OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go! (She storms out.)	Well, Phoebe I thought Id(Off Phoebes look)Yeah, what the hell. (Exits with Phoebe.)
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!	Hey babe.
Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they dont like us do they? (They gave them a pok-a-dotted punch bowl.)	Who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it?	How about to the street say from the balcony?
Why dont we just find a place for it?	Okay. How about in that cabinet?
No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?	How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the bathroom.)
Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it?	Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile. (Tries the door.) Its locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?
No reason. I-I keep private things in there.	Oh yknow, Ive been living here a while and Ive never seen whats inside that closet. What is, what is in there?
Feminine stuff.	Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youll let it go.	Fine.
Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)	(walking casually away) Love you.
(entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!	Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said, If it helps! (Goes to the bedroom.)
Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)	I wasnt trying to open your closet! I wasnt trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)
Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?	Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it.
Why not?	I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?!
I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard.	Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!	And here we go
Break	There has got to be a way!
Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?	Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-old girl.
Then why do you throw like one?	Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Sure. Monica.	So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the loc	Thats a good idea.
Yeah.	Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Oh, I justI feel terrible.	Well, its not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Yknow? Youre doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his bab
Oh Rach thats great. Thats great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)	Not to shabby, I got this all off myselfusing my wifes tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see whats behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my
(entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!	(laughs) Youre messy.
Oh no! You werent supposed to see this!	I married Fred Sanford!
No Chandler, you dont understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? Im yknowIm sick.	No, honey youre not sick! Look, I dont love you because youre organized, I love you in spite of that.
Really? You promise you wont tell anyone?	Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.
Wellits just ummIm afraid you might mess it up.	Hey.
Hey.	So Rachels all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldnt stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, its a couple	Are you okay?
Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joeys legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.	Happy Valentines!
(from her bedroom) Okay! Ill be right out. Im slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.	(picking up a video from the table) Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits dow
on TV: Yeah, just relax.	I love you, St. Valentine.
on TV: Yeah, just relax.	Woah, woah, thats not pretty!
on TV: Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!	Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on the remote control, frantically.)
on TV: Ohhh! Make it stop!	I am trying!
(to herself) Ive still got it!	(pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
What is it?	Its yellingbleedingdilating. Oh, the dilating
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it?	I thoughtmaybeyou got me porn for Valentines Day.
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in searc	Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now.
Honey, whats going on?	Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Mm-hmm.	How long it took to go back in the water?
Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day!	You dont know. You didnt see it.
Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful.	Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like hes going to throw up!)
Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!	See, honey, theres(puts his hand on her leg)
How long has it been this time?	90 seconds.
Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about itexcept all I did was think about it.	You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?	I can do that.
Okay.	Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Oh, thank God!	Oh, I know!
Oh, my God.	Poor Ross.
Oh, my God.	Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here.	Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: dont watch it.
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?	Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Shes rightof course not. Honey, get the tape.	(with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.
Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!	Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Oh, my God!	Wait, you guys, look!
What? Did her ass explode?!	No, the babys out! Look, look!
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!	And look how happy the mom is now!
Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!	Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) Shes growing inside you.
Whoa!!	Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
Wow that was a big one.	I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
(entering) Oh hey you guys!	Oh hey!
Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?	No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist.
Okay, good.	Why?
Well last night, I met Monicas.	What?
Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.	Come on, dont be crazy. (To Rachel) You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at him.)
Of course, of course.	A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet.	Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about.
Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.	You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
(mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.	(mouths to Phoebe) What?
Not really.	Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.) On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still theres staring.) No?
Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you.	What are you doing?!
Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So	I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.	Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Excuse me?	Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a great little villa you can stay at.	Is it made of cheese?
Id move in tomorrow!	(disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
Im so sorry.	What do we do?
Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice?	Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon.	Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Jeez! What is with you?	Im sorry, did you say cheese?
All right, whats going on?	Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a 
Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates?	No. But Im sure (mimics Don) tomatoes does.
I dont believe in soul mates either.	You dont?
No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.	So youyou dont want to live with Don in a cheese house?
No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?	I love you.
I know.	Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica doesnt look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so 
Hey!	Hey!
Is Joey here?	I dont see him. (To Monica) Do you see him?
Sure.	What?! No! No!
I cant! Yknow? You guys dont know what its like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.	(incredulous) I dont know what thats like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, I love you, was, Oh crap!
Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your	(interrupting him) We didnt play it!!
Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.	I didnt know you read tea leaves.
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.	What does yours say Pheebs?
Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it!	Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors.
(noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guysfor the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the s	Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.	I know its tough now, but things will get better.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?!	Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?	Lets just say if I cant find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?	In the James Taylor case.
Where is the James Taylor CD?	Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.	Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre?
Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?	They were just giving those away at the store (off Monicas look) in exchange for money.
Date: Its awfully pink. (Ross mouths, Its salmon!)	Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.	What problem did you tell him you had?
All right. (Gets up and walks out.)	(singing) The sunll come outtomorrow! Betyour bottom dollar that tomorrow (The girls start laughing, and in a deep voice) therell be sun.
What?!	and Monica: What?!
(To Joey) I cant believe that you yelled at my boss! Im-Im gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!	You can always sell your baby.
Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment	Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyre not in the baby buying business.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?	Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room?
Yeah.	Ill be in there. (Goes into the bedroom.)
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.	Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said that?
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry.	And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Credits	What are you doing?
Oh Im working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)	Its a dog.
Its a dead dog. Thats Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.	Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk about their dead pet?
Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?	Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.
Hey!	Hi!
No, no, no wait! Dont tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, Im kidding all ready y	Ha!
Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents?	Yeah.
What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room CI feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the pro	I dont think the flash went off.
Come on!	Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
No, they look too weird.	What are you doin?
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be fighting for breath.	Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could (Punches the air).
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows wh	If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh 	Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?

(popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!	All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!	Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn.

Really? Me? Wow! I dont even know any huge gay people!	It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.	Youre turning into a woman.

(simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!	(simultaneously with Ross) No!
I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?	Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin! (Waves.)
Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?	Bogota.
Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.	What does a Wicked Wango card do?
I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.	Higher or lower than what?
This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)	(To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question.	This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath (Ross cuts him off by taking a deep breath and holding it.)
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, TrisHoly cow, thats a big word. Trisc Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?	Let me see that.
This one right here. (Ross whines.)	Triscadecaphobia.
No! No, fear of the number 13.	Fear of Triscuts?
Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?	This game makes no sense!
Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing.	Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here.
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.	Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.	Either, it makes no difference.
Choose, you jackass!	Ill take a card.
What?!	This game is kinda fun.
(To Chandler) You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you	I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.

Is he right? Am I reallyAm I awful?	No!
Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya. (To Chandler) What uhHow come youre not going?	I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.	And people say you dont pay attention. No, this is a much better job. Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!	Thats what I do now.
No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the 	The front page? You really do live in your own little world, dont ya?
Is that a real place? (Rachels stunned) Are they hiring?	(entering) Hey Phoebe! (To Rachel) Fatty!
Hey Chandler, why so fancy?	Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
Wait, I think I know someone who does that.	Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little nervous.
Yeah, just dont get your hopes up.	Why not?
Well, the interview	What about it?
Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression.	(shocked) What?!
Oh you dont know.	Are you serious?!
Yes, when I first met you, you were like, Blah, blah, blah. I was like, shhh!	What is it that I do?
Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy.	(To Rachel) Did you like me when we first met?
Oh okay, I see what youre doing there.	I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly?
Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.	Oh good. Good, because Im sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
All right, dont freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?	An hour.
I cant help you.	Phoebe!
All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So lets say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. Hi! Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange.	Chandler Bing.
Bing, what an unusual name.	Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. (Pause) Ill let myself out.
Thats right.	I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont micro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating.
Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on what you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do.	(suppressing a smile) What I do dois manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.	Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life.
You gotta go!	Oh! (Stands up.)
Okay, dont worry. Youre ready.	Really?
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great.	Okay.
Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)	also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
Interviewer: You mustve had your hands full.	That I did. That I did.
Interviewer: So lets talk a little bit about your duties.	(nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.
Interviewer: Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.	(trying not to laugh) I see.
Interviewer: But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.	(really try not to laugh) Good to know.
Interviewer: We can go into detail	No dont I beg of you!
Interviewer: All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.	(relieved) Really?!
Interviewer: Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did great.	Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Yknow Ive been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesnt understa
Interviewer: Poo?	Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall!
Interviewer: Poo?!	Ill look forward to your call. (Walks away.)
(interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get	Lets. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)
Credits	Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes out. You snooze you lose.	Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class.
Well then somebodys snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just abo	I havent seen this dress.
(still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)	You really want to take me?
Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you	So youre never actually going to pay me back?
Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts 	I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you.
(in a manly voice) Im gonna go shave. (Gets up.)	(in a manly voice) Yeah well, Im gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)
No ones here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!	This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
A little tall.	What?
Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)	Its just so glamorous.
Break	Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
You liked it? You really liked it?	Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Which part exactly?	The whole thing! Can we go?
Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.	I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?	I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later. (Starts to walk out.)	Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.
Hey! Sleeping beauty!	Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
(in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?	Im so sorry.
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Oka	What?!
Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything!	You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money
Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?	I dont know, five hundred dollars?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?	Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats (Pauses to figure it out.)	Do you want a calculator?
Please!	Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
All right, what else?	Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes
Which were still keeping under our hats!	Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) The south will rise again man.	Yes, money well spent!
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!	Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food
N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!	Hi!
Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we cant guarantee a private room and currently theyre all unavailable.	Man, if only youd gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)
Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?	Yeah?
Listen uh, I-Ive been doing some thinking, and I dont know whether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.	Okay.
(freaking out) What-what-whats that now?!	Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were ready.
Youre ready to have a baby? My boys all grown up!	But you said you were ready too.
Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!	Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever?
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?	Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us.
What?	Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. Were good. Were really good.
We are pretty good.	But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but maybe its right.	What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!!
What?!!	Im kidding. This is going to be fun.
So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying?	Were trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Okay, hold on a sec.	Period math?
Yeah.	Yeah.
Well, we could start trying. Now.	Right here?
No, not here. Maybe here.	Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and were in a building thats full of beds!
I think we found a place.	Okay. (They start kissing.)
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?	Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds its not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay
Okay. Lets hurryOh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)	Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine.
Enter Pheebs.	Should we tell Rachel theres an empty private room right next door to hers?
We could, or we can have sex in it.	Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
Does that sound like Janice?	If its not, then theres two of them. And that would mean its the end of the world!
Hey!	Hi.
Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?	Weirdest thing. Did I hear(A nurse opens the privacy screen and Chandler sees Janice)Mother of God its true!
Chandler Bing!	Jan-Janice!
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.	Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen?
Its you. This is yours.	What?!
(laughs) Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years! (Laughs again.)	Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Oh my God! Shes amazing. Oh, oh Im so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!	Its incredible, I mean one minute shes inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)	So, do you know what youre gonna call her yet?
Thats not her name! Im sorry, she just doesnt feel like an Isabella.	So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.	You do?
Yeah, Ive had them picked out since I was fourteen.	Oh no, its gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnt it?
Yeah, but I love you more. Besides yknow, nothing goes with Bing. So Im screwed. I mean (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, thats you. Youre our little Em. Oh whats that honey? What? Oh,	That was amazing.
I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.	And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Geller: Wheres my granddaughter? Ive been practicing my magic tricks.	He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Geller: So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve.)	Okay. Wow.
(taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?	Sure.
Dude I just did something terrible.	That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!	What?! Why does she think that?
Because it kinda looked like I did.	Again, what?!
Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand	As we all are at some point during the day.
It wasnt my ring! It fell out of Rosss jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!	Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
I guess.	And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
I know! I know its awful.	Well, what did she say?
(happily) She said yes.	Does Ross know?
Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?	Well maybe you dont have to tell him anything.
Oh, I like that. Yeah	If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
I want a baby.	Honey, weve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closets still available?	Im so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Geller: Well Im peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!	Hello sir, you know Monica.
Break	Look, we cant stay in here forever.
Oh, I still cant believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnt make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!	This is okay. Were all adults here; theres nothing to be ashamed of. Now, lets put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)
Geller: Of course. Ill always be your dad.	I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnt for fun.
It wasnt fun?!	(To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youWh-why (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just dont want you to think that were animals who do it whenever we want.
Geller: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thats how I got my bad hip.	Thats funny, this conversations how I got the bullet hole in my head.
Geller: But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?	Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
No. No, I dont. Could you be a dear and go tell him?	You still havent told Rachel you werent really proposing?
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.	Joey, you have to tell her whats going on! And what did it look like?!
I didnt look at it. Stupid babys head was blocking most of it.	Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Look, its not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I dont want to hurt her.	Okay, look, just do it gently.
(walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!	Hey.
(looking at Chandler sleeping with a balloon in his mouth) So sexy. (Waking him up.) Honey.	Yea yea. (Pulls the balloon out of his mouth)
Honey why dont you go lie down.	No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office (Pulls another balloon out of his mouth) Am I producing them?
Whyre you so tired?	Couldnt sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldnt sleep. Yknow? I was like, if I fall
See this is what I was afraid of, I didnt think I should be here either but somebody (Looks at Chandler) said hed be over it by now.	Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
McKenna: Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you Ill go straight to my forty two point plan.	Walter (nods).
McKenna: Ok if everyones on board, its settled, Chandler, (Walter puts his hand on Chandlers hand, Chandler sleeping puts his hand on top of his, he then wakes up and pulls his hand away) Chandler?	Yep.
McKenna: Are you on board?	(not knowing what hes saying yes to) Yes.
Alright you guys, we cant turn on each other, Okay? Thats just what she wants.	(enters) Hey.
Hey.	Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Oh Im kinda part of this.	Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Okay whats up	Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tas
Oh yeah (smiles).	Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
What? Who says that?	People whove never ever been to Paris.
Whats going on?	Were moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)
Excuse me?	Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
(stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!	The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Chandler, I dont even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!	Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Are you trying to tell me that were moving to Oklahoma, or that youre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?	No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monicas not impressed.) Ill get out of it.
Thank you.	(hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?
Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.	Umm maam, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I dont think I can move to Tulsa.
McKenna: What?	Its a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Id move to Tulsa, I didnt really know what I was saying.
McKenna: You fell asleep?	But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, aint that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, heres the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wont g
McKenna: Chandler, I	No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) Thats a picture of your daughter, isn
You know the book says that whenever shes sleeping I should be sleeping so (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)	(entering, loudly) Hey!
Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep	Oh so there cant be any yelling.
No.	Were moving to Tulsa
(loudly) What!?	Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! (Walks backwards towards the door) I cant, I cant hear you. (He runs out)
You know, ah, Ive been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, its not my fault. Its a natural instinct.	(enters) Hey, what you guys talking about?
	Picturing that tree? Ross: I am, yes. [Scene: Hallway, Joey get out of his appartment and Chandler jumps out of    his] Chandler: Where you going, Joe? (Joey falls on floor and gets up) Joey: For a wa
What's your news?	Thank you. I got a job in advertising. (Everybody cheers)
(inquisitive) Gosh, what's the pay like? (Everybody stares at her indignantly) Oh, come on people (defending) come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! (She 	Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.
Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.	Right. So, it'll be the same except less sex with you. (Joey nods)
So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?	Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.
(enthusiastic) That's great.	Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating
(enthusiastic) That's great.	(grinning awkwardly) Humiliating and noble!
(sitting down) Don't make me more nervous than I already am!	(entering) Good morning, everybody.
Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?	Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car.
Seriously, you're an intern?	Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
(shaking his head disbelievingly) Dude!	Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope (he sits down)
(shaking his head disbelievingly) Dude!	The comedian? USO?!
So far so good! (Joey nods)	(entering, carrying a large box) Honey, I'm old!
(standing up, walking towards him) What's wrong?	I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.	Yes, but I don't think life experience with these. (He opens the box and takes an inline skate-like sneaker out)
What are they? (They sit down again)	They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
(determined) I give you $ 500 for them!	What am I supposed to do with these?
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.	Well, first of all, they're not called sneakers anymore. Apparently, they're called kicks or skids and I think I heard somebody say slorps. (He takes a sneaker) And here, look: they've got these wheel
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?	No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?	Hey, hey!
Hey!	Hey!
What are you doing?	Putting on the sneakers thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything
Oh, anything yet?	Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
(entering) Hey!	Hey!
We gotta get more of that. (He leaves the apartment)	(sitting on the couch) You know what these aren't half-bad! (to Rachel) You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.	Alright (He stands wearing the sneakers on) I feel youger already!
Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.	(on the floor) Yah, I think I broke my hip.
(ironic) That's interesting! Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes. Who's next? (Chandler raises his hand) Chander	Okay (He stands up) You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age
(snorting) Your age?	A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and lau
Chandler, that's great!	Oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me (He sits down again)
You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's. (enthusiastic) You did you come up with that?	(over-enthusiastic) I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
That is great. Good work!	Thank you.
See all of you tomorrow. (He leaves)	The cold weather hurts my hip!
	Hey! Ready to go? Ross: Oh yeah, let me just finish this. Joey: Hey Ross, check this out! (he tries to spin a basketball on his fingertip but he throws it against a table) yeah, I can't do that! Chand
Haha! Phoebe: You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building. Monica: So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door. Phoebe: Those are my shoes. Monica: Oh,	Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... (&shy;looks at laptop screen)..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? Ross: uhu uhu, check this out. (Chandler sits down and looks at laptop
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such  a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)	You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.	You're on!
Sounds like he's with someone.	He could be alone. This morning I heard him do  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
Oh my God, that's Charlie!	She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
ooh...	Wow!
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?	How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?  No-one is manning that wall!
I'm on it!	Anything?
Bedsprings, unmistakable!	You do realise  that's your brother?
Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler  makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall.  Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joe	That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving  with Weird Al.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,  before we leave, I'm going to the salon.	Okay Buckwheat!
That's the door. He's gone...	And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...  Miss Congeniality!
(also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank  you! (walks to Phoebe)	(caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!
Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?	He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend  Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)
Well, if you see him could you please tell  him I'm looking for him?	You got it!
All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all  the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...	Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you  do one thing for us? The people that  care about you?
Sure...	Enunciate!
Hey!	Hey!
You guys ready to go?	Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm  just finishing packing.
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?	You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's  a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!	Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
What do you think?	I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells  tingle)	What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the  ears.
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting  next to Charlie after we broke up.	Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care  about your social life.
No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass  and gives Joey his one.)	Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't  wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!	You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Yeah!	So if you want people to see them, then by definition  you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be  able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her  hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she  brus	What are you singing?
It's Bolero from 10.	It's Ride of the Valkyries from Apocalypse  Now...  See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy  hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymor
You what? You said you liked them.	Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was  that I could see your scalp.
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.	Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...  Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,  and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!	Hit yourself in the tooth?
You're welcome!	Honey, you've been in there for a long time...  Is everything okay?
I have a problem.	Really? What happened?
Well, I was dancing around, and singing No Woman,  No Cry and I got stuck.	You can't move at all?
Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth  the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair  as she goes)	If I untangle you, will you please get rid of thecorn rose?
(looking disappointed) I guess so...	(trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little  frayed.
Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks  up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...	Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a  little something for me?
Sure, what do you have in mind?	I think you know.
Really? I don't really feel like it.	This is what I want to do.
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.	(Picks up the Miss Congeniality DVD) She's an  FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's  inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways  to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.	There's a hair in my coffee.
Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with  the triplets.	You know, it's funny. Every time you say triplets, I  immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.	So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this  room, huh?
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.	I mean, you have a lovely home.
I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.  Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.	That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?
I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.  Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.	You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
Can I adopt you?	Hey, you must be Owen.
Yeah.	I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
You were?	Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Huh?	You know how to use a compass?
I have a badge in it.	You do? That's fantastic!
You wanna see it?	I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your  parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
What?!?	What?
I'm adopted?	I got nothing.
 [Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the  living room. Monica is the only one there.]	Where are Bill and Colleen?
They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you  believe how nice they are?	We have to leave!!
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?	I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,  and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may  have told him.
I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we  haven't told him he's adopted yet.	But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he  already knows?
I'm adopted?!	See? Intuitive!
He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.	Which technically now you should give back!
You told him he's adopted?	I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or  something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the  door. Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa  is real.
He isn't?!	(to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate  us.	Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Still, he had to find out sometime.	Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets  that you gave birth to them?
Still, he had to find out sometime.	I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)
 1003 - The One With Ross' TanWritten by: Brian Buckner  Produced by: Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller  Transcribed by: Coffee Mug, Eleonora, Sebastiano &amp; Vanessa[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartmen	So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?
Yeah. It's actually our first official date 	Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.	What must it be like not to be crippled by fear  and self-loathing.
(pause) It's OK!	How can you be so confident?
Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!	Really? Like you have a routine?
No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have  to appreciate their uniqueness.	Really?
No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes.  Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.	You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh  in a funny and awkard way)
NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts  lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)	Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They  look at each other, both embarassed)
More foosball?	...and beer!!
(looking at Monica's legs) WOW!	Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop  staring at your sister's legs!
I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?	She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
(laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?	(To Monica) Why...why?
Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean,  it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!	Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can  really show it off.
Hey!	Hey Pheebs!
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me  too! She's the worst!	Who's Amanda?
She's this girl who used to live  in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up  this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda  using an 	Are you trying to do a British accent?
(pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets  pedicures!	Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Oh, I guess we could try that, but...  it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?	No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Ok, don&#8217;t hold thy breath!	Hello? Is someone on the line?
Yes, I was looking for Monica.	Hang on, she&#8217;s right here. (he enters the  living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.
We weren&#8217;t picking up, it&#8217;s  Amanda!	(to Amanda) I get pedicures!
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.	Was that place... The Sun?
Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler  and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body,  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)	Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory  all by yourself!
oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?	How was your date with Joey?
Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and  I kept slapping it away!	You didn't like that?
(sees what he is doing) Chandler,  stop! It is not going to pop open!	(without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't  know! (Monica just smiles)[Scene: Central Perk.]
(He just sits there, legs very close together with  a painful look on his face) Soldier down![Monica and Chandlers apartment.]	If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look  positively ghastly.	Well, aren't you a treat.
I don't know.	That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she  sure can dance... Hey!
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When  you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more  than that?	Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide  from you guys...
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it  was... really wrong?	Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt  like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it  was... really wrong?	I can tell from your expressions that that's the  good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the  joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)
Go away! I don't want to see anybody.	I know, I went to the tanning place and the same  thing happened to me. You have to let me in.
Dude, you're not tanned.	No, I just had to get a picture of this.
Dude, you're not tanned.	I see you later!
Rachel and Chandler: Hey!	Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
No,   that day... that won't be her real birthday!	Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday   was!
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away.   You know, to reconnect... emotionally.	There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.	Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this   party...
Hey!	Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Oh, she's still napping	Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party   she knows is happening.
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!	I know, what are we gonna do?
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really   hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!	I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Thank you so much for that gift!	(nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today!
(speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want   my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with   nuts!	To be fair this one does have nuts.
Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message   to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica   and Chandler) Ok!	Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way.  You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!	We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together   and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed   and switches the camcorder off)
(Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some   more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right   there. (Puts the phone down)	Was that Emma? Is she up? 
No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad   that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes   back here and all you guys are gone?	I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday! 
Got it! (Goes towards the front door  and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going? 	To the bathroom!
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards   the bathroom and enter)	(Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and   Joey come out looking shocked)
(Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you   guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)	You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..	I'm begging you stop.
(Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!	(Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going   to do in Vermont! 
Ok! I want the dolphin!	Thats a bear.
Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)	Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?	I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly   stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog   never crossed the finish line, so technical	They left.
Game?	Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old,   that's little.
Game?	Ooh! That's my girl!
That's how old you are.	Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
(embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...	Me too...
(embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...	There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
...and head to Canada!	I was kidding.
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?	No, not yet.
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks   you guys!	Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
What?	Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index   finger again)
Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow   out the candle. Come on Emma.	Let's do it, come on!
Of course, I'd be honored!	Thanks!
U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.	Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... Dear baby   adoption decider people...	So excited about your letter!
Hey!	Hey Phoebe!
YEAH!	So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in	That's where people make number two!!
Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to   Chandler) Here. And I think you&#8217;ll be very, very happy. It&#8217;s the   longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.	(reading) I don&#8217;t... uh... understand.
Of course it does! It&#8217;s smart! I used the the-saurus!	On every word?
Oh, &#8216;They are warm, nice, people with big hearts&#8217;.	And that became &#8216;they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens   with full sized aortic pumps...?
Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-what&#8217;s-wrong-with-that'   look). Hey, why don&#8217;t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just   be yourself!	You know what? You don&#8217;t need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.	I doubt that! Tell her about us lastyear.
Seriously?	Word!
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna   propose to me, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s ever gonna ask again! I mean,   I said no in Barbados and now this!	She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself  mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a  guy..?
I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright,   moving on...	Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points   to Ross and Chandler) like that?	Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think? 
	Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Yeah.	Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our   file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples   that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!	It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just   call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)
Okay good.	(on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped   off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh...   okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very 
Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way   to the bird store.	(Still looks confused) They loved it.
What?	They thought it was very smart of us to have a  child write the recommendation letter.
(surprised) They thought Joey was a child?	She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.	That sounds like fun.
Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would   it?	I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily)   ... but I am wrong!
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.	Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was   in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
(Sarcastically) O-Okay!	Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
(she enters) Hey...	Hey!
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...   (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!	OH!
Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe)   Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and...   (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!	Whoo!
Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no,  he  was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave  at Omaha Beach.	Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my   black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.   With Janice's phone number on it.
	(he enters) Hey honey!
(Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back.   Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!	Is Monica not here?
No.	Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for  a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!
Cool!	Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas   were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were  mine!!!
That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?	Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're   right for the part.
What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon!   Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired!   (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'	First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think   you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.
I can do that! (in a deeper voice) Hello, I'm   your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing.   I like to use... Oh, what's the product?	Software that facilitates inter-business networking   e-solutions?
Oh! Any word on casting yet?	Joe, I told you, you're just not right for   the part.
(to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's   not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I   am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, 	Joe...
Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't   pass it on to your bosses!	Fine!
Thank you. (he sits down)	Work, Joe!
Damn it! (he leaves)	(to Rachel): What am I gonna do now?
Just pass it to your boss!	He's not right for the part. So if I suggest   him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should   learn on their own!
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked   it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and   they're the bad guys.	That's good! I liked it, they didn't.   (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake,   go to work! (Joey runs away).
	Hey Joe!
What's up?	Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along   to my bosses and they weren't interested.
(sounds disappointed) Oh.	(Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.
(looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched   the tape?	(sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey   continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.   Stupid sons of bitches!
(sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.	(looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?	I'm not lying to you, I watched it!
Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room   and is observing the conversation)	I watched it!
Keep going Pinocchio!	(now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!
(yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards   his room)	(following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape.   (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)
Did you watch the tape?	a sarcastic of course not!-tone)   No!
	I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
But you are a liar.	What did I just say?
You still here?	Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am   insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...
Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok?   First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about   lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying a	Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
 Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you   didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door). 	He really is a chameleon.
She's mine!	Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And   I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part   or not.
That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you   lied.	I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you   to forgive me?
Now, what do you say?	Lying is wrong!
And?... AND?	I'm a pretty little girl.
Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.	That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea   how expensive this stuff was!	Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the   numbers.
So what did you two do about it?	It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting   solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!	(to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Hey!	Hey!
What's going on?	Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning   the apartment.
(sarcastically) We?	You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?	Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very   impressive when the little people know a celebrity.	(pointing at himself) Little people?
Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff   hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?	What...? NO!
Chandler?	(he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended   by the insinuation!
Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes   taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?	I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not   mine.
Ok.	Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door   and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
Yay!	But you already gave all your money to charity!
Well, I&#8217;ll just ask for it back!	I don&#8217;t think you can do that!
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some   stupid kids!	That&#8217;s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We&#8217;re really excited   about getting this process started.	Oh, because we love kids. Love &#8216;em to death.Well, not actually   to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...   as allowed by law.
Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby   before   them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)	But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
Oh...	What?
Yes!	Of course it was!
Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he   would call   me and he didn't.	RAT BASTARD!
What was that?	Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great   with   kids though.
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...	(Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
What's going on?	Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey   bangs on   the door again)
What's going on?	WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!! 
Is he alright out there by himself?	Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Bert and Ernie!	(nervous smile) You can't make this stuff up!
(Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't I show you the baby's room?	What the hell are you doing?
Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.	Well, we're not.
But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!	We don't have a code word.
(To Chandler) What room should we see next?	Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs nervously)
(quivering with anger) I did not care for that!	(escorting Joey to the door) You have to get out of here. You slept   with   our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so   she can't   see you.
Ok, ok! (He leaves)	Ok!
Ok, ok! (He leaves)	What?
Oh my God!	And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And   we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)
Are you friends with him?	I can explain... Joey...
(laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...	Oh, that's really ok.
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...   Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)	Wrong number?
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on   the waiting list.	That's great!
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's   a baby waiting for us. Oh... 	Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Or Win, Lose or Draw.	What did I marry into?
Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.	You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
(singing) ...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll!	(to Monica) I'm leaving you.
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.	Who?
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.	(looking around) Did I go to this school?
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.	(looks over at her) Sure, nice.
Dude. You're married to my sister. 	You're right, by saying nice I'm virtually licking her.
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?	Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!	Awesome, the name really stands out.
Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24 point!	Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Hey guys!	Hey!
Hey, Missy...	You know, our band is playing on Friday.
No way!	and Ross: Way!
Right. I'll be there. (she leaves)	Fresh!
Boss!	Mint!
She's gone.	I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.	I said it first, bro.
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.	(angrily) Look, if you did...
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.	Totally. I had sex in High school...
Me too. I'm good at it.	All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
You got it.	All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
Those are the pacts!	Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
	Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?	Your hands are shaking.
(To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?	(to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!
You broke the pact! 	Ross, that was 16 years ago!
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.	I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
I didn't.	Oh really?
No.	Oh really!?
NO!	ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)
Yes?	and Ross: Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.	Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
I don't know what... you're talking about.	Really?
Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).	Aren't you...?
Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).	(smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing? 
Bitchin'	Hi Monica.
Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)	O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)
I didn't know you knew about that.	Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: Betrayal In The Common Room.
(looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.	Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.	(smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..
We are even, right?	(sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
(thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?	Not her!
That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)	Soo... you girls having fun?
(finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow. 	Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
(sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?	Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
(blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers Oh my God!)	So where are you applying to? 
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!	I'm in college and I'm in a band. 
Oh my God! That's wild!	Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
Well, it matters to me.	Why?
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.	You kissed her that night too?
Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.	Seriously, where did this happen?
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, 	Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Mine.	I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
No, she was definitely on my bed. 	Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
You were my first kiss ever?	What did I marry into?
	Hey!
Hey!	You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them. 
Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?	No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!	(to Rachel) You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.	Heh.
Oh, man!	This is like figure skating team all over again. (Phoebe and Ross glare at him astonished) I mean synchronized swimming. (they continue to glare) I mean- I mean the balance beam. (to Ross) Help me!
FOOTBALL!	Thank you.
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.	I know, I hate being left out of things.
Hey guys, how is it going?	Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.	What happened?
I'll do it!	(standing up too) M-Me-me-me!
You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.	Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.
(to Chandler) Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.	Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!
Please, you're going down!	You are going downer!
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?	(almost crying) I wouldn't know, I didn't make it! (they hug)
I decided to pee.	Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!	Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
Hi	Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.	Let me tell you why you need to pick me. (Goes to sit on the couch facing backwards to the kitchen. Rachel gets a chair and sits opposite him) See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everythin
All right fine, I pick you.	(Getting up and raising his fist in victory) Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make groom for Chandler.
	How's it going? 
(smiling to himself) Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.	(smiling to himself too) That's what I was doing too.
(barely containing himself at this point) Well, you have fun tonight.	You too. 
Oh, I will.	Me too.
Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you? 	I'm not supposed to tell you. 
I'm not supposed to tell you!	You told us both we could be in the wedding? (they both stare at Rachel)
Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again. (he winks at her and Rachel looks disgusted)	Rach, Rach, knock knock.
Who's there?	I'll tell you at the wedding.
(to Chandler and Ross) You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.	So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
I guess.	and Ross: I'll do it!
No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?	I'm not scared. (moves towards Mike and Chappy) I'll just take little Chappy and... (he backs out) HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.	(quickly) I'll do it.
I'll...	(to Ross) Na ha ha... (to Chappy) Ne he he... (Ross moves Chappy to Chandler, who quickly backs away) Ah ah...
Okay. (in her microphone) It's zero hour. All teams execute on my count. (to all) Let's get this bad boy on the road.	(to Monica) Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
(checking her clipboard) I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.	Oh yeah! (Monica walks outside)
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? (into microphone) We've got a broken arrow. Bridesmaid down! (realizes) Oh, that's me.	Ready?
(nervously) Okay.	Okay.
Oh wait, oh no. Wait.	Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
I don't care... I'll be my something blue.	You look beautiful.
BREAK	That really was an incredible wedding.
It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?	I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?	I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
Hi	Hey! Hi!
Oh!	So, where's Mike?
CREDITS	Hey.
Hey.	Why are you wearing my apron?
I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.	Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child? (she's not amused) No? Divorce?
Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...	Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes Mooooo!
Honey.	I'm so sorry...
Everyone. Erica, baby!	Monica. Calm, self.
Welcome to New York City! Or should I say ghe deu flooff New York City?	Why would you say that?
Oh yeah, let's do that!	Great! (to Monica) This baby'd better to be really good.
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.	(enters the room wearing an I love New York t-shirt, a Statue of Liberty hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!
What is with you?	Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)	Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? 
Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)	That's great. 
Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. 	So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too? 
No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy. 	I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
Are you awake? 	Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)
Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy. 	Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?	I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is. 
How? 	I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. 	Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm!
	Hey! How was lunch?
(To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles	(struggling) Oh, really? 
No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.	O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?
Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.	Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it? 
(smiling) No it's not. 	How do you know? 
Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. 	Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
The thing we never do.	(nods in appreciation) Shovely Joe!
Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.	Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.	You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it. (she shrugs)
Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! (they all look at each other when Ross grabs a plate) Guess what happened at work today...	A dinosaur died a million years ago?
(while entering) Hi you guys.	Hey.
Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...	YOU NEVER DID IT!
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.	Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.	Mrs Hannigan?
(enters) Hey guys.	Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.	Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!	Damn it.
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.	That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.	Hey, how'd the interview go?
Oh! It's not good.	You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.	That is a bad interview.
I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!	(except Rachel): Congratulations! (Rachel looks devastated)
Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. (Gunther leaves, hurt) Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. 	Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
...that center around work.	To Ross!
...that center around work.	(except Rachel): Ross!
Thank you for letting us see the house again.	And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.	What?
(squinting his eyes) Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!	When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.	Man, those two dogs are going at it!
(entering) Hey!	Hey.
Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.	Really? What changed your mind?
Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.	Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
(frightened) What?	Ha! I'm just messing with you.
What? I get my own room?	You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
Oh my God! (they all hug) Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?	and Monica: No!
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.	It's seven years ago. (he looks surprised) My time machine works!
So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.	Excuse me?
Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.	For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
Should we send something?	How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one.	That's great!
Previously on Friends...	How did the job stuff go?
So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?	Or facing a bitch of a commute.
I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...   Anything we want.	My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle. (Monica   looks at him and can't really place what he just said)
You okay with this?	Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Talking to Ross.	I see.
How is that gonna happen?	Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next   door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna   take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.	We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse   us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?	What do you think Pheebs?
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin   Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?	Yeah.
She died.	You're kidding!
Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across   the Atlantic. (Chandler and Monica look puzzled) Oh, wait a minute, I read the   wrong one.	Oh yeah? 
Joey's gonna be *so* upset. 	I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the   Atlantic.
What if he reads it in the paper?	Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
Thanks.	It feels like we&#8217;re cheating on our house.   And if we&#8217;re gonna cheat, shouldn&#8217;t it be with like a hot, younger house,   that does stuff that our house won&#8217;t do?
Oh my God!	(to Monica): Sure.
	And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man   out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! (does her irritating   laugh). So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! A	(at Janice's punching) Don't, don't! (looks disgusted)
No, actually, we're buying the house next door. (Janice gasps)	(To Monica and with bulging eyes) Why!?
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence.   But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to   get it! (Chandler and Monica are utterly shocked) Ellen, we're going to talk   nu	This can not be happening!
Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.   Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.	The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple   are the Hitlers.
(Thinks a little more) Okay, Okay, (clapping her hands)   All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house   into a guest house.	That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful,   but when did you start crapping money!?
Okay, you come up with an idea.	Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on   our house. We can still get out.
But we love our house.	Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder   out here too. Just the crickets and (apes Janice's voice) Oh My God! 
Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever   we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise.   I mean, never again will you have to hear the t	(looks afraid, but at the same time, knows she's right) Well, we   have to do something. We can't have her living next door. (Janice's laughs loudly   outside) Oh, that does it too. (Motions with his 
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see   you later, neighbor. (Janice laugh)	Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to   be here.
Oh, me too... (laughs)	Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
Huh?	I never stopped loving you.
Oh... my...	Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice   Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
Chandler, what are you talking about?	Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and   Monica never have to know a thing.
I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this...   heat between us.	(stunned) Obviously.
But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't   think we should get this house now.	Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.	I understand.
Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... (she kisses   Chandler flat on the mouth. Chandler squirms. When she's finished, he looks   at her lovingly but uneasily.) Goodbye Chandler Bing.	(speaking as in pain) They're never coming down now.
Damnit!	Hey!
Hey!	So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you! (they hug)	Where's your passport?
It should be right next to my plane ticket.	Well, it's not.
Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!	(to Joey): At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
(enters the room): Are, are you kidding? This is packing?	We're taking a break!
From?	Jumping on the bed?
You got it! (Monica leaves, Ross closes the door). All right, she's right, we gotta get serious. (He grabs a bag of styrofoam peanuts) Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!	No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
You guys hear a ringing?	(holding a pair of furry handcuffs) What the hell is this?
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.	I didn't know Monica had these!
Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!	Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
(entering the room) Hey.	Hey.
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?	I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. (Ross and Joey looks puzzled) I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. (he stops and starts realizing something) Wait a minute...	Yes, Joe?
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these (she holds the furry handcuffs) on my pillow.	Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! 
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.	Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.	Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Rachel used to live in that room.	Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting! (he looks excited)
Joey's bare ass!	(he doesn't look excited anymore). Well played.
(to Joey) Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said	Uh, Rach?
I really made you think about that thing uh?	(to Rachel) Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you. (shows her the cuffs)
(laughs) Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.	No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...	Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.	Pheebs!
(from the other side of the room) Yeah!	I think these are yours.
(to Chandler) Can I talk to you alone for a minute?	Sure. (to Phoebe) You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
Oh honey... 	Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. An
(all mushy) Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you. (they hug) 	Ooh, not so tight... (blows raspberry, and the hug ends) I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Oh!	I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. 
I don't think so. 	Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.	That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. 
I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.	No, no, no, no!
Yeah. Mine too.	Mine was a humdinger  
Tell me about it.	Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.	Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.	(to Joey) You couldn't be cool. (he goes to the guest bedroom)
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.	Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
You did? How?	Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Who's that dirty old lady?	Monica's grandmother.
Hi!	Hey!
Oh my God!	Relax! We just get her some antacids.
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.	Oh my God!
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh 	Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Chandler, wait, wait, wait...	What?
Oh my God!	Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!	Oh my God!
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.	Next time, can I say breathe?
Alright, I'll be right back.	Where are you going?
To use the bathroom.	You can't leave me alone with her.
What?	This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not   comfortable with!
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?	It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone   together.
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two   minutes.	Okay.
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two   minutes.	So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
I don't know. Maybe church-camp?	Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which   is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
What?	Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will   ever know, because no one can experience both.
What?	One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who   knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
Help me! This hurts!	Is it really that bad?
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have   ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!	I'm okay.
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your   child! It's the miracle of life!	Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
It's a... It's a boy!	Wow!
Oh, you did it!	(emotional) It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some  other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?	Well, that's spongy.
(to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on  the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!	I know. He has your eyes.
(to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on  the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!	I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.	Okay.
I'm really happy for you guys.	How do you feel?
You know it's twins, right?	Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never   happened before.	Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Twins actually run in my family.	Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?
Twins actually run in my family.	What do we do?
What do you mean what do we do?	(panicking) Twins! Twins!!
Chandler, you're panicking!	Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
We can't split them up!	Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and   then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean,   that's a great day for everybody.
Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?	What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.	Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't   care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't   care if the entire cast of Eight is Enough comes out of there! We 	(smiles) Okay. Shhh...
That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't   care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't   care if the entire cast of Eight is Enough comes out of there! We 	Okay.
Okay!	Okay!
Here she comes!	(shocked) She? It's a girl?
Yeah.	(To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor)   And that's enough!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?	Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in   apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're   pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Bye!	Bye!
Okay.	Have fun at church-camp!
Oh, look at these little bunnies!	I know! You ready to trade?
Okay.	Okay.
Alright, let's see..	We could trade later.
Hi! Oh my gosh!	Hey.
(points at the baby she's holding) This is a boy, (points at   the baby Chandler is holding) and that's a girl.	Her name is Erica.
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.	Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time  together.
I love you.	I love you.
This is so cool!	I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...	We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but  now we understand you were doing this.
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!	Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now  they're gone!	Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.	Alright.
Oh!	It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Just put it on a plate and leave.	Okay, let's find these birds.
Oh! They're in the table!	Well, that can't be good!
We gotta get them out of there!	How?
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?	Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.	Joey, wait! The ball!
Oh God! So what do we do?	I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Okay.	No... It's all glued together.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?	I don't know. Maybe.
Oh my God!	I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would   have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. Those are our   men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sa	Did that movie ever get made?
(yelling) Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of   there.	And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Okay. Here goes.	What's the matter?
I need to say goodbye to the table first.	I understand.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you   guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You   guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?	I don't know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches   the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game,   good game, good game, good game, good game.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.	Well, I can't do it either.
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!	We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Alright. My job here is done.	That was... Impressive.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get   back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.	Sorry about the table, man.
Yeah.	You gonna buy a new one?
Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play   after you go.	Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Yeah.	Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get   used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds   around again.	Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
What?	Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus,   here they'd have their own room.
I could get a goose!	You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to   stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a   reason to come visit.	I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame   cool guy handshake?
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.	Wow, this is weird.
Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.	Where's Ross?
Has it always been purple?	(to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first   home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But   more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our   keys.	Oh, okay.
(crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.	Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Okay, should we get some coffee?	Sure. Where?
