c'mon, you're going out with the guy! there's gotta be something wrong with him!	all right joey, be nice. so does he have a hump? a hump and a hairpiece?
okay, everybody relax. this is not even a date. it's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.	sounds like a date to me.
oh, yeah. had that dream.	then i look down, and i realize there's a phone... there.
instead of...?	that's right.
no.	all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. now i don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
and they weren't looking at you before? !	finally, i figure i'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...	cookie?
no!! okay?! why does everyone keep fixating on that? she didn't know, how should i know?	sometimes i wish i was a lesbian...  did i say that out loud?
i don't want to be single, okay? i just... i just- i just wanna be married again!	and i just want a million dollars!
now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.	 tuna or egg salad? decide!
if i let go of my hair, my head will fall off.	 ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
i helped!	please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
what, like there's a rule or something?	please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
yes!	ooh, this is a dear diary moment.
hey! paul! hi! the wine guy!	i'm sorry, i didn't catch your name. paul, was it?
right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god.. no, no, although, aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.	 yes, and we're very excited about it.
i'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.	it's a beautiful thing.
 what's this?	i would have to say that is an 'l'-shaped bracket.
which goes where?	i have no idea.
done with the bookcase!	all finished!
hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.	yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
you guys.	oh, god.
you got screwed.	oh my god!
shut up!	you must stop!
that only took me an hour.	look, ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento. you, however have had the love of a woman for four years. four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! i don't think that was my point!
i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny.	stay out of my freezer! [scene a restaurant, monica and paul are still eating.]
)	angela's the screamer, andrea has cats.
 grab a spoon. do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon? do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?	angela's the screamer, andrea has cats.
isn't this amazing? i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life.	that is amazing.
y'know, i figure if i can make coffee, there isn't anything i can't do.	if can invade poland, there isn't anything i can't do.
hello, paul.	hi, paul, is it?
okayyy!	all right, kids, i gotta get to work. if i don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
look, it was a job all right?	'look, gippetto, i'm a real live boy.'
i will not take this abuse.	you're right, i'm sorry. once i was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...
are you kidding? i'm trained for nothing! i was laughed out of twelve interviews today.	and yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off!	oh, how well you know me...
cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..	 y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
 would anybody like more coffee?	did you make it, or are you just serving it?
yeah. yeah, i'll have a cup of coffee.	kids, new dream... i'm in las vegas.
ugh. excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? go ahead. thank you.	okay, so, i'm in las vegas... i'm liza minelli-
absolutely.	yeah, i think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? i mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out.
yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.	the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
whose little ball of paper is this? !	oh, uh, that would be mine. see, i wrote a note to myself, and then i realised i didn't need it, so i balled it up and...  ...now i wish i was dead.
look , i'm sorry, guys, i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.	yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
that's because as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong. y'see, he's the prince. apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born.	 ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
what?	ugly naked guy got a thighmaster!
easy rach, we'll find it. won't we!	oh! yeah!
doy! probably right before she lost it!	you don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
i know i had it this morning, and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with...	...dinah?
oh, but look how straight those noodles are!	now, monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
 i just... can't do it.	boys? we're going in.
yeah. do that for another two hours, you might be where i am right about now.	kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon?
what does she mean by 'involved'?	i mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
yeah. we don't speak. she's like this high-powered, driven career type.	what does she do?
chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this.	well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
what are we supposed to be seeing here?	i dunno, but.. i think it's about to attack the enterprise.
since always. it's like dating language. y'know, like 'it's not you' means 'it is you'.	or 'you're such a nice guy' means 'i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
yeah. cushions the blow.	yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.	hey, that was really good!
thanks! let's keep going.	okay. so. whaddya want from me, damone, huh?
i just wanna go back to my cell. 'cause in my cell, i can smoke.	smoke away.
what?	relax your hand!
whoah!	hey!
hey!	alright, now try taking a puff.
no no no, i am not giving you a cigarette.	it's fine, it's fine. look, do you wanna get this part, or not? here.
y'miss it?	nah, not so much. alright, now we smoke. oh.. my.. god.
- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.	oh, satan's minions at work again...
what is this? !	i'm smoking. i'm smoking, i'm smoking.
oh, i can't believe you! you've been so good, for three years!	and this- is my reward!
hold on a second, alright? just think about what you went through the last time you quit.	okay, so this time i won't quit!
ohhh! put it out!	all right! i'm putting it out, i'm putting it out.
no. not after what happened with steve.	what are you talking about? we love schhteve! schhteve was schhexy!.. sorry.
really!	oh, yeah. i'd marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone. you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
i mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.	yep, we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
yeah, it's his, uh, innate alan-ness that-that-that we adore.	i personally could have a gallon of alan.
i know! i know, i opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!	well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? like, collect all five?
it's worse than the thumb!	hey, this is so unfair!
oh, why is it unfair?	so i have a flaw! big deal! like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?	hey, y'know, i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
chandler? it's alan, he wants to speak to you. 	really? he does? hey, buddy, what's up! oh, she told you about that, huh.
 hey. where's joey?	joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him. do you think that was wrong?
 there y'go.	 ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now.
i'm sorry..	 oh, she's sorry! i feel better!
you had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.	...that's it. i'm getting cigarettes.
no no no!	 i don't care, i don't care! game's over! i'm weak! i've gotta smoke!
 if you never smoke again i'll give you seven thousand dollars!	 yeah, alright.
yeah, see.. you took mine. chandler, what about you?	uh, if i were omnipotent for a day, i'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
...ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. see, i told you! less than a hundred steps from our place to here.	you got waaaay too much free time.
 hey! here's the birthday boy! ross, check it out hockey tickets, rangers-penguins, tonight at the garden, and we're taking you.	happy birthday, pal!
so, i'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?	well, aren't we mr. the glass is half empty.
what's wrong with the twentieth?	eleven days before halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
the hell with hockey, let's all do that!	 c'mon, ross! you, me, joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  huh? huh? huh?
what are you doing?	 i have no idea.
alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?	you got it.
god, isn't this exciting? i earned this. i wiped tables for it, i steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. who's fica?	 oh, this is not that bad.
leetch spots messier in the crease- there's the pass!	we'll take a brief time out while messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
peach pit.	yes, bunny?
actually, nectarines, but basically...	 could've been a peach.
 sorry, sorry... uh-oh.	what? there was ice there that night with carol? plastic seats? four thousand angry pittsburgh fans?
get him! get him! get him! get- yesss!	 see buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
pass it! pass it!	he's open!
shoot! shoot! shoot!	hey, look, we're on that tv thing!
 it says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. well, i'm not completely satisfied.	listen, it's kind of an emergency. well, i guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
i remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.	yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- could i get some painkillers over here, please?
look, it's just a little more complicated...	well, what? what? what is it? that she left you?
little louder, okay, i think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...	then what?
with carol? oh.	so in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.
man. can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?	i think it's great. y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
really?	no, you kidding? the guy's a freak..
 oh, that's attractive.	oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs. oh come on, admit it! all things considered, you had fun tonight.
i found it. finders keepers, losers weepers.	you gotta do it, man.
could've played monopoly, but nooooo.	thanks.
okay, pheebs right hand blue. good.	hello? oh, uh, rachel, it's the visa card people.
oh, okay. will you take my place?	alright. yes, this is rachel.
 i've got magic beans. never-never mind.	to the left, to the left- aww!
come on! you guys can pee standing up.	we can? all right, i'm tryin' that.
no plans, huh?	not a one.
not even, say, breaking up with janice?	oh, right, right, shut up.
chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. you just gotta do it.	no, i know, but it's just so hard, you know? i mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
you know, if you want, i'll do it with you.	oh, thanks, but i think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home. oh, it was horrible. he called me young lady.	ooh, i hate when my father calls me that.
 ok, bye. well, monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and rachel.	oh. well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
it's laundry. the thinking through is minimal.	it's just you and rachel, just the two of you? this is a date. you're going on a date.
nuh-uh.	yuh-huh.
so what're you saying here? i should shave again, pick up some wine, what?	well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. this is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
 no.	oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
ok, ok, now what is wrong with my snuggles? what, it says i'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. ok, i can pick something else up on the way.	there you go.
this is nice. we never do anything just the two of us.	it's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
eww, i don't wanna do that.	here we go.
ok, have a good break-up.	hey, janice.
oh, my god, i am so glad you called me. i had the most supremely awful day.	hey, that's not good. can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
we got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, i blew off the rest of the day, and i went shopping...... and i got you, i'm looking, i'm looking, i'm looking, i got you...	what?
what?	 what... did you get me there?
i got you...these.	bullwinkle socks. that's so sweet.
well, i knew you had the rockys, and so i figured, you know, you can wear bullwinkle and bullwinkle, or you can wear rocky and rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. whatever you want.	that's great.
 no, no, i'm still working on mine.	that's it?
yeah, it was really hard.	oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
ok, you can do this. it's just like pulling off a band-aid. just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.	janice. hi, janice. ok, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore.
ow!	oh, my god, i'm so sorry. are you ok?
ow. um, it's just my lens. it's just my lens. i'll be right back.	 i hit her in the eye! i hit her in the eye! this is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
oh my god. how many of those have you had?	oh, i don't know, a million?
chandler, easy, easy. go to your happy place. la la la la la la la.	i'm fine.
all right.	i'm not fine. here she comes.
wait here. breathe.	how do you do that?
it's like a gift.	we should always always break up together.
oh, he needed some time to grieve.	i'm free! i'm free!
 ooh! look! look! look!	you can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?	 ross, ten o'clock.
is it? feels like two.	no, ten o'clock.
what?	 there's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
oh. hel-lo!	she's amazing! she makes the women that i dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
well, go over to her! she's not with anyone.	oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'excuse me. blarrglarrghh.'
oh, c'mon. she's a person, you can do it!	oh please, could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up here.
he could never get a woman like that in a million years.	thank you, buddy.
you could do that!	y'think?
yeah!	oh god, i can't believe i'm even considering this... i'm very very aware of my tongue...
c'mon! c'mon!	here goes.
...yes?	hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... chandler! chandler is my name, and, uh......hi.
yes, you said that.	yes, yes i did, but what i didn't say was what i was about to say, what i wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
 saw your head. saw your head.	 she said yes!! she said yes!! awful play, man. whoah.
 no, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.	well, i can't believe i've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
oh, right, right. how was your date, 'chand-lrr'?	it was unbelievable. i-i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life! she was in the israeli army...
...luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. so, we made it to the border, but just barely, and i- ...i've been talking about myself all night long, i'm sorry. what about you? tell me one of your stories.	alright. once i got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and i rode it all the way to brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
...all of a sudden we realised we were in yammon.	oh, i'm sorry, so 'we' is?
who's rick?	who's rick?
ooooohhh.	oh, so you're divorced?
no.	oh, i'm sorry, then you're widowed?...hopefully?
no, i'm still married.	so tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
don't worry. i imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with ethan.	ethan? there's, there's an ethan?
what? !	so explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
i suppose mainly sexual.	...hm.
oh. i'm sorry it didn't work out.	what 'not work out'? i'm seeing her again on thursday. didn't you listen to the story?
didn't you listen to the story? i mean, this is twisted! how could you get involved with a woman like this?	well, y'know, i had some trouble with it at first too, but the way i look at it is, i get all the good stuff all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. i mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
tah-daaah!	are we greeting each other this way now? 'cause i like that.
 i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.	thank god you didn't try to fan out the magazines. i mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
why would someone do that?! ...one might wonder.	someone's left a glass on the coffee table. there's no coaster. it's a cold drink, it's a hot day. little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
c'mon, you guys. this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it, and that's big!	oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
thank you!	where's joey? his mom's on the phone.
he's in the bathroom. i don't think you wanna go in there!	c'mon, we're roommates! my eyes!! my eyes! !
who is being loud?	oh, that would be monica. hey, listen, i wanna borrow a coupla things, aurora spent the night, i really wanna make her breakfast.
oh, you got the whole night, huh?	yeah, well, i only have twenty minutes until ethan, so, y'know..
ooh, do i sense a little bit of resentment?	no, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'kay? y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? well, every- single- second is like that with aurora.. and i've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. monica, can you help me with the door?
thank you.	no, actually i meant my fingers. look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
 oh my god, i'm late.	oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..
okay.	don't go.
okay. oh no, i have to.	 too bad, she's leaving.
 i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me.	well, i thought- i thought you talked to rick.
it's not rick.	what, ethan? he got to spend the whole day with you!
no, it's-it's andrew.	i know there'll be many moments in the years to come when i'll regret asking the following question, but- and andrew is?
he's... new.	oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?
no, that's not exactly what i was..	well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
so what do you want?	you.
you have me!	nono, just you.
whaddyou mean?	lose the other guys.
...like, ...all of them?	c'mon, we're great together, why not?
why can't we just have what we have now? why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight i thought that's what you wanted too.	...well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like i'm two guys, y'know? i mean, one guy's going 'shut up! this is great!' but there's this other guy.
so... which one of the two guys will you listen to?	i don't know, i-i have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
which one?	...the second guy.
 well, call me if you change your mind.	sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
no? what happened, big guy?	 big guy?
my mom will.	something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
 hi mom, it's jill.	she's right, it's jill. jill goodacre. oh my god. i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre!
 yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank, in an atm vestibule.	jill says vestibule... i'm going with vestibule.
 i'm fine. no, i'm not alone... i don't know, some guy.	oh! some guy. some guy. 'hey jill, i saw you with some guy last night.

what's up man?	i'm trppd... in an atm vstbl... wth jll gdcr.
 oh my god! he's trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre! chandler, listen.	yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
would you like some gum?	um, is it sugarless?
 sorry, it's not.	oh, then no thanks. what the hell was that? mental note if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it. if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
my god, you're choking! that better?	 yes... thank you. that was... that was....
chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! now watch, it's easy.	ok.
well, this has been fun.	yes. yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
well, goodbye chandler. i had a great blackout. see ya.	hi, um, i'm account number 7143457. and, uh, i don't know if you got any of that, but i would really like a copy of the tape.
hey gorgeous, how's it going?	dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
question. you're not dating anybody, are you, because i met somebody who would be perfect for you.	ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
do you want a date saturday?	yes please.
okay. he's cute, he's funny, he's-	he's a he?
um... yeah. well, i mean, when i first met you, y'know, i thought maybe, possibly, you might be...	you did?
yeah, but then you spent phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then i figured maybe not.	huh. did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
nono, me neither. although, uh, y'know, back in college, susan sallidor did.	you're kidding! did you tell her i wasn't?
no. no, it's just 'cause, uh, i kinda wanted to go out with her too, so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman... who also liked her, so...	well, this is fascinating. so, uh, what is it about me?
i dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...	ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
yeah! right!	what is it? !
yes. absolutely. a quality.	oh, oh, a quality, good, because i was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
 hey. look, i'm sorry about yesterday, i, um-	no, nono, don't- don't worry about it. believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
oh! okay! phew!	so, uh... what do you think it is about me?
i dunno, uh... you just have a-a...	...quality, right, great.
y'know, it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple.	lowell? financial services' lowell, that's who you saw me with?
what? he's cute!	well, yeah... 's'no brian in payroll.
is brian...?	no! uh, i d'know! the point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, i'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
well, i think brian's a little out of your league.	excuse me? you don't think i could get a brian? because i could get a brian. believe you me.
 morning. we ready to go?	well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...it's stuff like that, isn't it?
what?	nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent mussberger.
check it out, giants-cowboys.	you're watching a football game at a funeral?
no, it's the pre-game. i'm gonna watch it at the reception.	you are a frightening, frightening man.
here, sweetie, here. i took these when i had my golfing accident.	oh, no-
sorry- hi, i'm dorothy's daughter.	hi, i'm chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.
...chandler!	hey.
yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. can we be grown-ups now?	who are those people?
hey, chandler.	so how's it going there in financial services?
it's like mardi gras without the paper mache heads. how 'bout you?	good, good. listen, heh, i dunno what shelley told you about me, but, uh... i'm not.
i know. that's what i told her.	really.
yeah.	so- you can tell?
pretty much, most of the time. we have a kind of... radar.	so you don't think i have a, a quality?
speaking for my people, i'd have to say no. by the way, your friend brian from payroll, he is.	he is?
yup, and waaay out of your league.	out of my league. i could get a brian. if i wanted to get a brian, i could get a brian. hey, brian.
hey, hey.	hey.
hey.	and this from the cry-for-help department. are you wearing makeup?
yes, i am. as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor slash model.	that's so funny, 'cause i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man slash woman.
you know, the asthma guy was really cute.	do you know which one you're gonna be?
no, but i hear lyme disease is open, so...	good luck, man. i hope you get it.
and i assume, chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.	yes, every single one of them.
absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop. only a hundred and two dollars to go.	i thought it was $98.50.
oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything. i can show you. look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.	i'd just like to say that i'm totally behind this experiment. in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head.
wait, wait, chandler, this is what you're havin' for thanksgiving dinner? what, what, what is it with you and this holiday?	all right, i'm nine years old.
oh, i hate this story.	we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner. i have--and i remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
oh my god.	yes. it's very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.	tonight, on a very special blossom.
i got the tickets! i got the tickets! five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.	oh, you must stop shooping.
chandler, will you just come in already?	no, i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
look out, incoming pumpkin pie!	ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
ok, good-bye you guys. thanks for everything. oh, sorry! oh, sorry!	the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has just gotten away.
the balloon?	no, no, the actual cartoon character. of course the balloon. it's all over the news. right before he reached macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park.
i can't, i gotta go.	come on. an 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. how often does that happen?
no, no, no, you said, got the keys.	do either of you have the keys?
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?	 for an emergency just like this.
why? because everything is my responsibility? isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner for everyone? you know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes.	ok, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. here we go.
stop it, stop it, stop it!	now this feels like thanksgiving.
by all means.	ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
the bigger half.	i'd like to propose a toast. little toast here, ding ding. i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. anyway, i was just thinking, i mean, if you'd gone to vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
and a crappy new year.	here, here!
that is so cruel! why? why would a parent name their child bethel?	hey, that monkey's got a ross on its ass!
so you guys, i'm doing all new material tonight. i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.	might wanna open with the snowman.
hey, do you guys know what you're doing for new year's? gee, what?! what is wrong with new year's?	nothing for you, you have paolo. you don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! man, i'm talking loud!
yeah, you wish!	it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday. i say this year, no dates, we make a pact. just the six of us- dinner.
yeah, okay. alright.	y'know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing, then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!	 that guy's going home with a note!
well, he's kinda like the guy i went to see that with. except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... i just- i just wanna be with him all the time. day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...	wait a minute, wait a minute, i see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to new year's, aren't you. you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact.
no, no, no, no, no, no. yeah, could i just?	yeah, 'cause i already asked janice.
c'mon, this was a pact! this was your pact!	i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped.
yeah, but janice? that-that was like the worst breakup in history!	i'm not saying it was a good idea, i'm saying i snapped!
hi. hi, sorry i'm late.	too many jokes... must mock joey!
nice shoes, huh?	aah, y'killing me!
i didn't wanna leave him alone. alright? we- we had our first fight this morning. i think it has to do with my working late.	y'know, if you're gonna work late, i could look in on him for you.
oh, that'd be great! okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.	okay, but if he asks, i'm not going to lie.
i'm sorry, okay. it's just that chandler has somebody, and phoebe has somebody- i thought i'd ask fun bobby.	fun bobby? your ex-boyfriend fun bobby?
you know more than one fun bobby?	i happen to know a fun bob.
oh, it's-it's marcel. he keeps shutting me out, y'know? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands...	that's so weird, i had such a blast with him the other night.
really.	yeah, we played, we watched tv.. that juggling thing is amazing.
what, uh... what juggling thing?	with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.
no.	y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. he just balled up socks... and a melon...
i love this artichoke thing! oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!	you remember janice.
look at him. i'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.	 but you found me!
 there you are! haaah, you got away from me!	 but you found me!
here, ross, take our picture. smile! you're on janice camera!	kill me. kill me now.
 oh, i'm gonna blow this one up, and i'm gonna write 'reunited' in glitter.	alright, janice, that's it! janice... janice... hey, janice, when i invited you to this party i didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
oh, no. oh, no.	i'm sorry you misunderstood...
oh my god. you listen to me, chandler, you listen to me. one of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.	oh, will you give me the thing.
there y'go, kids.	 and then the peacock bit me. please kiss me at midnight.
you seen sandy?	ooh. uh, i don't know how to tell you this, but she's in monica's bedroom, getting it on with max, that scientist geek. ooh, look at that, i did know how to tell you.
 in twenty seconds it'll be midnight...	and the moment of joy is upon us.
not everybody's happy. hey bobby!	y'know, i uh.. just thought i'd throw this out here. i'm no math whiz, but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
perfect. perfect. so now everybody's getting kissed but me.	alright, somebody kiss me. somebody kiss me, it's midnight! somebody kiss me!
 folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'euphoria unbound' the always interesting nora tyler bing. you might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.	y'know, we don't have to watch this. weekend at bernie's is on showtime, hbo, and cinemax.
c'mon, she's your mom!	exactly. weekend at bernie's! dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! no?
chandler, i gotta tell you, i love your mom's books! i love her books! i cannot get on a plane without one! i mean, this is so cool!	yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch.'
c'mon, chandler, i love your mom. i think she's a blast.	you can say that because she's not your mom.
your mom was arrested?	shhh, busy beaming with pride.
 ...this is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after i've been intimate with a man...	now why would she say that's embarrassing?
 ...i just get this craving for kung pow chicken.	that's too much information! !
awww!	this is the way that i find out. most moms use the phone.
 oh no, i am a fabulous mom! i bought my son his first condoms.	...and then he burst into flames.
i am famished. what do i want...	please god don't let it be kung pow chicken.
oh, you watched the show! what'd you think?	well, i think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. gimme a hug. well, i think we're ready for some tequila.	i know i am.
oh, please, honey, listen, if i can do it, anybody can. you just start with half a dozen european cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! you have got yourself a book.	myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
you don't kiss your friend's mom! sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!	what are you guys doing out here?
yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.	okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
you're my friend. i-i had to tell you.	i can't believe it. paolo kissed my mom?
yeah, um, i don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  i can't do this, i did it, it was me, i'm sorry, i kissed your mom.	what?
i was really upset about rachel and paolo, and i think i had too much tequila, and nora- um, mrs. mom- your bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- but nothing happened, nothing- ask joey, joey, uh, came in-	 you knew about this?
uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.	i spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me? !
thanks, man, big help.	 i can't believe this! what the hell were you thinking?
i wasn't- i mean, i-	y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you.
i know-	i can't believe you did this.
me neither, y'know what-	i'm still mad at you for not telling me.
chandler-	you gotta let me slam the door!
 okay, that was phoebe buffay, everybody. woo!	what was that?
oh, uh, phoebe just started a...	yeah, i believe i was talking to joey, alright there, mother-kisser?
chandler, can i just say something? i-i know you're still mad at me, i just wanna say that there were two people there that night. okay? two sets of lips.	yes, well, i expect this from her. okay? she's always been a freudian nightmare.
okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?	because it's complicated, it's complex- hey, you kissed my mom!
 we're rehearsing a greek play.	that's very funny. we done now?
no! okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?	that would be no. look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. alright? trust me, you can't talk to her.
car's waiting downstairs, i just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. anything you want from lisbon?	no, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
alright, well, be good, i love you.	you kissed my best ross! ...or something to that effect.
 o-kay. look, it, it was stupid.	really stupid.
really stupid. and i don't even know how it happened. i'm sorry, honey, i promise it will never happen again. are we okay now?	yeah. no. no...
you okay, kiddo?	yeah, okay.
alright.	nice save.
mr. geller.	hey.
you mean that?	yeah, why not. so i told her.
yeah? how'd it go?	awful. awful. couldn'ta gone worse.
well, howdya feel?	pretty good! i told her.
ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.	and, we're done with the yogurt.
i know...	 ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
i love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...	ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
need a new table.	you think?
that's the rule.	what rule? there's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
how'd you get to that?	well, i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio
you knew about that?	well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
ok, ok, how about if we split it?	what do you mean, like, buy it together?
yeah	you think we're ready for something like that?
why not?	well, it's a pretty big commitment, i mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
why, are you moving out?	i'm not moving out.
you'd tell me if you were moving out right	yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate kip...
aw, i know all about kip!	it's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
well, let me ask you something, was kip a better roommate than me?	aw, don't do that
hey, chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.	fine.
whoa, store will be open tomorrow!	more coffee over here, please!
thanks rach.	so what are you gonna do?
you have to tell her! you have to tell her! it's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, i think it's a feminist issue! guys?	oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
will you pick one, just pick one! here, how about that one?	that's patio furniture!
so what, like people are gonna come in and think, uh-oh, i'm outside again? of course!	 what about the birds?
i don't know, birds just don't say, hello, sit here, eat something.	you pick one.
all right, how about the ladybugs?	oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!	not like that, i won't! kip would have liked the birds!
i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen.	i know!
come on, two on one.	what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
yes, now is when you swoop! you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out of there, the first guy rachel sees is you, she's gotta know that you're everything he's not! you're like, like the anti-paolo!	my catholic friend is right. she's distraught. you're there for her. you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of ross!
i'm having a boy! oh, i'm having a boy!	wha-
hey!	hey!
uh, it's 230 in the morning!	yeah, get out!
you guys are always hanging out in my apartment! come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh? come on, wussies! all right, ok, i gotta go.	 one more game?
that is it! you just barge in here, you don't knock	i'm sorry!
you have no respect for anybody's privacy!	rachel, wait, wait.
no, you wait! this is ridiculous!	can i just say one thing?
what? what? !	that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your... nipular areas.
okaaay. any of you guys want anything else?	oh, yes, could i have one of those.
no, i'm sorry, we're all out of those. anybody else?	okay.
did i, uh, did i miss something?	no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies.
you what? wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?	it was an accident. not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
okay, pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change.	y'know, i don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
nice? they were nice. i mean, that's it? i mean, mittens are nice.	okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.
you're so funny! he's really funny! i wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.	whoah whoah, back up there, sparky. what'd you mean by that?
oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.	huh.
i mean hey! i just met you, i don't know you from adam. ...only child, right? parents divorced before you hit puberty.	uhhuh, how did you know that?
i know, i mean, why can't parents just stay parents? why do they have to become people? why do they have...  why can't you stop staring at my breasts?	 what? what?
alright, alright. we're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. since you saw her boobies, i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.	y'know, i don't see that happening?
c'mon, he's right. tit for tat.	well i'm not showing you my 'tat.'
c'mon up.	 oh, good. rog is here.
yeah.	oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... i hate that guy.
night, you guys.	oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
oh no, not you, big joey. oh my god, you're so much cuter than your pictures! i-i'm, i'm ronni....cheese nip?	uh, joey's having an embolism, but i'd go for a nip, y'know?
now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.	joey, if i go first, i wanna be looking for my keys.
thank you. uh...	so, who's up for a big game of kerplunk?
thanks. you're, uh, you're a good kid.	c'mon, i'll show you to my room. ...that sounds so weird when it's not followed by no thanks, it's late.
just trying to get comfortable. i can't sleep in my underwear.	well, you're gonna.
i've been thinking. y'know, about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls...	are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
y'know what i mean, about how i'm always going out with all these women. and i always figured, when the right one comes along, i'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? now i'm looking at my dad, thinking...	hey, you're not him. you're you. when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
no.	no. you decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. now that wasn't easy, but you did it! and i'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say no thanks, i'm married.
you really think so?	yeah. i really do.
thanks, chandler.	get off!
i thought it was chandler!	 what? what?
you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing!	sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
i dunno, there's just something about...	basically we just feel that he's...
wow.	things sure have changed here on waltons mountain.
just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.	if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... i'll end up like my mom.
she barely knows me. we just live in the same building.	any contact?
hey.	come on, ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbiani don't think we need a third...
yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, here's your egg back, i'm returning your egg.	i think it's winning.
i think it's insane.	she'll love it. go with the egg, my friend.
think it'll work?	no, it's suicide. the man's got an egg.
actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.	oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
no, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. the only reason she's goin' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend.	yes, i know, but her friend sounds like such a...
hi. she said yes.	yes! way to go, man! still got the egg, huh?
 how do i look?	oh, uh, i... don't... care. ok, now, remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.
hi, joey. well well, look what you brought. very nice.	...and what did you bring?
she's checking the coats. joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. will you get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for janice.	janice?
oh.... my.... god.	 hey, it's janice.
no, no, no, don't! i've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with lorraine. just calm down.	calm down? calm down? you set me up with the woman that i've dumped twice in the last five months!
 can you stop yellin'? you're makin' me nervous, and i can't go when i'm nervous.	i'm sorry, i'm sorry, you're right. come on, do it, do it, go, come on!! !
by the way, chandler. i cut you out of all my pictures. so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads.	that's ok.
 we can't do that.	 what? what can't you do?
uh, we might be leaving now.	tell me it's you and me we.
she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. i'm not even sure what slathering is, but i definitely want to be a part of it.	ok, you can not do this to me.
i'm outta here. here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler.	i hope she throws up on you.
just us.	oh, what a crappy night!
although, i have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.	excuse me. how ya doin'?
so, do we have the best friends or what?	joey's not a friend. he's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. another drink? some dessert?
i will go for that drink.	you got it. good woman! could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
each.	that's right, each. oh, and a uh rob roy. i've always wanted to know...
oh, i miss you already. can you believe this happened?	no... no! and yet it did. good-bye, janice.
hi, monica.	ok, well, this was very special.
oh my god. janice, hi!	janice is gonna go away now.
 whoa.	oh, good, joey's home now.
i don't know. you dumped her on new year's.	oh, man. in my next life, i'm coming back as a toilet brush.
hello, funny valentine.	hi, just janice.
i brought you something.	is it loaded? oh, little candy hearts. chan and jan forever.
i had them made special.	ok, janice. janice. hey, janice. look, there's no way for me to tell you this.
that's fine.	 it is?
mmm-hmm. because i know that this isn't the end.	oh no, you see, actually it is.
no, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. don't you know it yet? you love me, chandler bing.	oh, no i don't.
well then ask yourself this. why do you think we keep ending up together? new year's? who invited who?	i did, but...
you seek me out. something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. janice, janice. you want me.	call me!
chandler.	mrs. tedlock. you're looking lovely today. and may i say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
yes. well, mr. kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.	oh, listen. if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them. really. nothing at all.
hey you guys! chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...	hey!
what is it?	so, it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers, and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
that's great!	so.... i quit.
why?	why? this was supposed to be a temp job!
yeah, chandler... you've been there for five years.	if i took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do.
so was it a lot more money?	it doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the wenus.
... the wenus?	weekly estimated net usage systems. a processing term.
so what're you going to do?	i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know what i want to do. i just know i'm not going to figure it out working there.
oh, yeah, no, i know. you're a chef. i know, and i thought of you first, but um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....	yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
 um... hi there.	yeah... i just don't have that much cheffing experience. unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
so, what do you think?	thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
 oh my god!	thanks, phoebe. but i just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
where are you going, mr. suity-man?	well, i have an appointment to see dr. robert pillman, career counselor a-gogo. i added the a-gogo.
career counselor?	hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
i don't!	hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. you know, you have goals. you have dreams. i don't have a dream.
so great! he showed me where the restaurant's going to be. it's this, it's this cute little place on 10th street. not too big, not too small.	was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
ok, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?	who are you going out with?
oh, i just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and i'd introduce her to my monkey.	and he's not speaking metaphorically.
my god! what happened to you?	eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do i learn? you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.
that's so great! 'cause you already know how to do that!	can you believe it? i mean, don't i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? you know, i just always pictured myself doing something...something.
 here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.	ooh, you know, i had a grape about five hours ago, so i'd better split this with you.
it's supposed to be that small. it's a pre-appetizer. the french call it an amouz-bouche.	 well.... it is amouz-ing...
oh! i see. and i've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that i can waitress in the olympics.	you know, i don't mean to brag, but i waited tables at innsbruck in '76. amouz-bouche?
...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...	....with? ?
you're not going to believe this!	it's ok. it's ok. i was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
hey chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.	again?
and again.	 hey mr. kostelic! how's life on the fifteenth floor? yeah, i miss you too. yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?
 wow! it's huge! it's so much bigger than the cubicle. oh, this is a cube.	look at this!
oh! you have a window!	yes indeedy! with a beautiful view of...
oh look! that guy's peeing!	 ok, that's enough of the view. check this out, look at this. sit down, sit down.
 ok.	this is great! helen, could you come in here for a moment?
theres the waitress. excuse me, miss. hello, miss?	its phoebe! hi!
hi. okay, will that be all?	wait, wait! wh-what are you doing here?

congratulations, i think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.	im just trying to find the right moment, you know?

youre kidding? she seems so...	oh, no, no. nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! in fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
thats unbelievable.	and yet, believable. so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
i see. i guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.	well, i guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
aw, how can you say that? i cant even get marcel to stop eating the bath mat. how am i gonna raise a kid?	you know, ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
do you have a sec?	ah, sure, nina. whats up?
i dont know. for the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.	oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
maybe. but that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.	ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
i am?	sure, why not?
oh my god! youre amazing!	oh, you dont know. helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinders raise?
what?	helen drinks. will you marry me?
oh, howd she take it?	pretty well. except for the stapler thing. little tip if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand...  ..on the desk.
i mean, i know joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...	youre not gonna lose him.
i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid.	that's nice.
right, but, it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinkin' they can take us. and so i uh, hah-hah, i just heave it down field.	what are you crazy? that's a baby!
anyway, suddenly i'm down field, and i realise that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? only i know there is no way i'm gonna get there in time, so i am running, and running, and that, that is when i woke up. see i, i am so not ready to be a father.	hey, you're gonna be fine. you're one of the most caring, most responsible men in north america. you're gonna make a great dad.
oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the rainbow room? is it real expensive?	well, only if you order stuff.
you take your time.	there it is! so what're you gonna do?
what can i do? look, i don't want to do anything to screw it up with ursula.	and your friend phoebe?
well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. i mean, wouldn't you guys?	man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
what? monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute!	alright, what have we learned so far?
oh...	 happy birthday peehe.
 oh, oh, oh! this is so great! oh my god! this was not at all scary.	did you see betty?
uh-huh.	say your son never feels connected to you, as one. say all of his relationships are affected by this.
do you have a point?	you know, you think i would.
it's just a fur ball.	okay...  ..whose turn is it?
yours, i just got 43 points for 'kidney'.	no, no, you got zero points for 'idney'.
what's goin' on?	marcel swallowed a scrabble tile.
yeah. the doctor got the 'k' out. he also found an 'm' and an 'o'.	we think he was trying to spell out 'monkey.'
well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.	 so, you feel like a dad yet?
no, why?	hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. that is very dad.
do you really want a job with popular mechanics?	well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for.
hey, guys.	hey.
 give me that!	you know, i can't believe you. linda is so great! why won't you go out with her again?
i don't know.	is this still about her whole 'the flintstones could've really happened' thing?
no, it's not just that. it's justi want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...	...little playthings with yarn?
what?	could you want her more?
who?	 dee, the sarcastic sister from whats happening.
shut up!	we're notwe're not saying anything.
thank you.	 we were playing poker, alright...
oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'read 'em and weep.'	and then he did.
oh, ok, so then what is it? some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?	there just don't happen to be any women in our games.
congratulations!	ok phoebs, how many do you want?
whoa, whoa, whoa, monica, what're you doin'? this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable. it's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...	 ok, so at this point, the dealer...
but... i'm ready, so, just deal.	ok, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. joey... three... eight. eight... three. alright babe, deal the cards.
whoa, whoa, whoa!	rach, rach, we gotta settle.
settle what?	the... jamestown colony of virginia. you see, king george is giving us the land, so...
...yeah.	yes, and i get my ya-yas from ikea. you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
alright boys, let's eat.	oh, did you get that from the 'i love rachel' pizzeria?
you still on that?	oh, come on. what was with that whole black bart speech? when i play poker, i'm not a nice guy!
guys! guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!	um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending trident?
alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.	oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, i don't know... pictionary?
oh, i cursed it. so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.	that's alright, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway. this way i can break 'em up with a movie.
you guys, you know what i just realized? 'joker' is 'poker' with a 'j.' coincidence?	hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'c'!
chandler?	couldn't be more out.
let me see! show them!	y'know, i've had dates like this.
i'm in for fifty cents.	call.
that's ok, ross, you can ask me. what?	 what do you need, what do you need?
fifteen.	alright, here's ten.
thank you.	good luck.
 ahhh, that's alright. y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.	 i thought we had them!
ok, ok, it's my turn.	go.
suck-fest.	toootal chick-flick.
alright, i've gotta go. c'mon, marcel! c'mon! we're gonna go take a bath.	they're still just friends, right?
i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief.	i mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened already?
well, i think it's perfect. y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...	i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.
anyway, i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.	hey, y'know what you should do? you should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?	rachel lost marcel.
alright alright. you're a monkey. you're loose in the city. where do you go?	okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. i'll go to cats, you go to the russian tea room.
marcel?	marcel?
hi, can i help you?	um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
a monkey.	yes have you seen any?
hope you find your monkey. 	oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
did i put too much rum in here?	oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?	yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! and they're very hot.
we can't, alright? we're sorry. you have no idea how sorry, but... we promised we'd find this monkey. if you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.	okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
marcel?	marcel? !
that's because i'm in front of them.	eh. i thought that was an alp.
i dunno, i loved high school. y'know? it was just four years of parties and dating and sex.	yeah, well i went to boarding school with four hundred boys. any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
oh, that is so sick.	i feel violated. and not in a good way.
so have you called her yet?	let her know i like her? what are you, insane? it's the next day! how needy do i want to seem?
oh, god, just do it! call her! stop being so testosteroney!	which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat. i got her machine.
her answer machine?	no, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.
so, uh, why didn't you say anything?	oh, no-no-no-no. last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase yes indeedy-o.
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon! oh!	 and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.
oh!... right!	hey rach!
yeah, but it was different with him today! and he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, y'know? i mean, we had fun! is there anything wrong with that?	yes!
why?	i have my reasons.
that's what you've been working on for the past two hours? !	hey, i've been honing!
what was with the dishes?	oh, uh.. i want her to think i might be in a restaurant.. y'know? i might have some kind of life, like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.	what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that.
yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.	yes, it's working! why isn't she calling me back?
y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.	y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
...desperate, needy, pathetic?	ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.
how many beeps?	she answered.
y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.	i'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed. god, i miss just being needy.
please. if she said to you, ross, i want you on this couch, right here, right now, what would you say?	if it helps, i could slide over.
 i just have to go, all right? do i need a reason? huh? i mean i have things to do with my life, i have a jam packed schedule, and i am late- for keeping up with it.	hello? hello?
 hello? mindy! hi! hey, how are you?	so how's mindy?
brrrrrrr!	hell is filled with people like you.
get down?	...and boogie!
oh, hold up, i'll walk out with you. now, rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  that's fine, yeah...	okay, i'm gonna go to the bathroom. will you watch my phone?
why don't you just take it with you?	hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
why don't you just call her?	i can't call her, i left a message! i have some pride.
do you?	no! danielle, hi! it's, uh, it's chandler! i'm fine.
don't you have to pee?	's'why i'm dancing...
four letters circle or hoop.	ring dammit, ring!
 hey, you know our phone's not working?	what? !
i tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.	 i turned it off. mother of god, i turned it off!
hey, so listen, i went across the street and talked to the doorman- i got the peeper's name! can i use the phone?	nngghhh!!!!!! !
 chandler?	danielle! hi! uh- everybody, this is danielle, danielle, everybody.
hi. hi.	what are you doing here?
well, i've been calling you, but it turns out i had your number wrong. and when i finally got the right one from information, there was no answer. so i thought i'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.	...i'm, i'm okay.
listen uh, maybe we could get together later?	that sounds good. i'll call you- or you call me, whatever...
you got it.	okay.
second date!	...i dunno.
you don't know? !	well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if i was okay? i mean,... how needy is that?
i think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.	wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.
what? it's, it's just a phase.	well, that's what we said about joey...
no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.	joey... switzerland?
plus, y'know, i think it should be joe. y'know, joey makes me sound like i'm, i dunno, this big. which i'm not.	joe...joe...joe...stalin?
stalin...stalin...do i know that name? it sounds familiar.	well, it does not ring a bell with me...
 joe stalin. y'know, that's pretty good.	might wanna try joseph.
joseph stalin. i think you'd remember that!	oh yes! bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin. joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof.
 hi.	hey.
at the vet.	she's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
hey! he beat ya.	so what does this mean?
she says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.	so what does this mean?
i can't believe it, ross. this sucks!	i don't get it, i mean, you just got him. how can he be an adult already?
how do you get a monkey into a zoo?	i know that one! ...no, that's popes into a volkswagen.
well, we're applying to a lot of them. naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, san diego... right? but that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility.	yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. i mean, it's a total party zoo.
hey. we found her, we found the girl.	what?
nope. we took her to lunch.	ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.
yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.	...take off their hats!
 you know there already is a joseph stalin?	you're kidding.
apparently he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. you'd think you would've known that!	y'know, you'd think i would've.
well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. otherwise it's just cruel.	he- he- he got in, he- he got in to san diego.
we, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...	...he's in.
oh!	okay, bye, champ. now, i know there's gonna be a lot of babes in san diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
shut up!	tell me what?
look at you, you won't even look at him.	 oh, come on tell me. i could use another reason why women won't look at me.
doing it on this table.	wow!
why, why, why would you dream that?	more importantly, was i any good?
well, you were pretty damn good.	interesting, cause in my dreams, i'm allways surprisingly inadequate.
i love it, when we share.	you're okay there?
i can't belive you two had sex in her dream.	i'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
just for some short-term-work. you know, until i get back some of my massage clients.	pirates again?
hey, hey, chan. she could work for you.	 thanks joey, that's a good idea.
what... i could, i could do it. what is it?	well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. she is having one of her boobs redused. it's a whole big boob story.
i could be a secretary.	well, you know phoebs. i don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. for a large portion of the day.
no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am. i mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-jimbo.	a cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
he's... our age.	when we were?
college?	whoa! and this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
 yeah?	see that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
 mr. bing's office. no i'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.	i'm not in a meeting. i'm right... whoops.
will he know what this is in reference to? and he has your number? all right, i'll see that he gets the message. bye bye.	what?
ross says hi.	ah!
this is so fun. all right, what do we do now?	well, now, i actually have to get to work.
most likely. okay, i'm gonna be out there.	okay.
all right. bye bye.	bye bye.
whatcha doin'?	ooh.
oh, exellent. everyone was so, so nice.	see, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. me.
no, i didn't tell anybody that i knew you.	why not?
oh, because, you know... they don't like you.	what? !
i thought you knew that.	noho. who doesn't they like me?
everyone. except for uh... no everyone.	what are you talking about?
don't feel bad. you know they used to like you a lot. but then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like mr. boss man. you know, mr. bing.	i can't belive it.
yeah, yeah. they even do you.	they do me?
you know like... uh okay... uh... 'could that report be any later?'	i don't sound like that.
'my scones.'	okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true.
no, forget it.	oh, why not. was i doing anything particularly... saucy?
no. you know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.	and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
stegosaurus!	tyrannosaurus!
um, oh, i've got a birthday party, with some work people.	work people? nobody told me.
no, i know. that's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.	you know, i don't get this. a month ago, these people were my friends. you know, just because i'm in charge doesn't mean i'm a different person.
well, then you should come tonight. you know, just hang out with them. let them see what a great guy you still are.	you think i should?
i really do, yeah.	okay.
okay.	okay.
you were great. but they still made fun of you.	what?
you know, now you're more like, you know like, mr. caring boss, mr., you know, i'm one of you, boss, mr., i wanna be your buddy, boss man bing!	then, i don't get it.
well, you know what chandler? i think you've gotta face it. you're like, the guy in the big office, you know. you're the one that hires them, that fires them... they still say you're a great boss.	they do?
uh huh. but they're not your friends anymore.	i just wan't to...
no, but you can't.	but i just wa...
loved your stevie wonder last night.	thanks. listen, about the weekly numbers, i'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock.
no problem.	you have to give 'em something, you know. okay, now that was gerston, santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
petrie.	petrie, right, right. okay, some people gonna be working this weekend.
monica, let's go. come on now people, woman in labor.	 hey ross, look what i've got going here.

all right, i'm going. i'm going.	here we go, here we go.
i'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.	yes, joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's.
what, it's ok when chandler does it?	you have to pick your moments.
susan wanted a chunky. we're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for chunkys.	i used to have that bumper sticker.
i want a baby.	mmmm. not tonight, honey. i got an early day tomorrow.
get up. come on. let's get some coffee.	oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
no fair. i don't even have one. how come they get two?	you'll get one.
oh yeah? when?	all right. i'll tell you what. when we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
why won't i be married when i'm 40?	oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
ok, hypothetically, why won't i be married when i'm 40?	no, no, no.
what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?	 uh, uh.
well?	dear god! this parachute is a knapsack!
well, where is he? he is supposed to be here. what if the baby needs him?	rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? was, like, your father a doctor?
yeah, why?	no reason.
now, mom, everything's going fine, really. yeah, ross is great. he's uh, he's in a whole other place. no, he's gone.	where have you been?
oh, just had a baby.	mazel tov!
relax. you're only at nine centimeters. and the baby's at zero station.	 you are really frightening me.
good luck!	 let me ask you, do you have to be carol's lesbian life partner?
oh, god, i can't believe one of us actually has one of these.	i know, i still am one of these.
ben, i want you to know that there may be some times when i may not be around, like this. but i'll still always come back, like this. and sometimes i may be away longer, like this. but i'll still always come back, like this.	and sometimes, i'll want you to steal third, and i'll go like this.
pardon?	nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. pffft. pffffffft.
hey, chan, can you help me out here? i promise i'll pay you back.	oh, yeah, right, ok... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
i will, really. i'll pay you back this time.	... and where's this money coming from?
we've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...	 men are here.
we make fire. cook meat.	then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.	crazy bitch.
hey!	hey!
no no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. do you guys know who carl is?	uh, let's see... alvin... simon... theodore.... no.
oh no! how can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?! ?	forget about her.
he's right, man. please. move on. go to china.	course there, they just call it food.
we want you to be happy. and i may only have a couple beers in me, but... i love you, man.	i'm still on my first. i just think you're nice.
like the three musketeers, only with fruit.	 ooooh.
well, thank you, melanie.	 ok, this one right here is from me.
there is a little child inside this man!	yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
who's this from?	oh, that's ross's.
it was like months ago. we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl. oh! i can't believe he remembered!	well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
i can't believe he did this.	come on, ross? remember back in college, when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
what did you just say?	 ahem... um... crystal duck.
no, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?	 f-hah.... flennin....
oh.... my god.	 oh, no-no-no-no-no....
i know. this is really, really huge.	no it's not. it's small. it's tiny. it's petite.
nuh-uh. i don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.	ok, is there a mute button on this woman?
ross? all this time? well, i've got to talk to him.	 h-he's in china!
no, no, wait. his flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.	what about the time difference?
from here to the airport?	yes! you're never gonna make it!
i-i-i don't know.	well then maybe you shouldn't go.
noooo... look, all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him. i mean, this is just too big. y'know, i just, i've just gotta talk to him. i... i gotta... ok, i'll see you later.	rachel, i love you! deal with me first!
shhhh!	 ...spender.
she's still asleep.	so how'd it go?
oh, it was amazing. you know how you always think you're great in bed?	the fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
well, it's like, last night, i couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. so i had to do all this other stuff. and the response i got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!	yes, i know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
it was amazing! and not just for her... uh-uh. for me, too. it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind.	i didn't know you had another level.
seven hundred bucks!	alright, you did it! do we have any fruit?
man, hell of a two weeks, huh? y'know what, though? i really feel like i learned something.	really? so, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
guys, you got your hair cut.	yes, yes, we did, thanks to vidal buffay.
 airport, airport. ross, not alone, julie, arm around her. cramp, cramp.	ok, i think she's trying to tell us something. quick, get the verbs.
you, you, you said he liked me. 	well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised.
yeah, it's really 600 tomorrow night our time.	well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause i like to be surprised.
thank you.	hey, rach, can i get...
did you talk to him?	not yet.
then, no.	so what the hell happened to you in china? i mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
i know, i know i was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. you know whose voice that was?	god?
it was you, pal.	well, maybe it was god, doing me.
look, you were right. she looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. but then i met julie, and i don't know, we're havin' a great time. and i have to say, i never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.	well, you owe me one, big guy.
so uh, what did you find out?	he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! without any outside help whatsoever.
but...	he said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. i'm sorry. but, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! without any outside help whatsoever.
how is that the silver lining?	you have to really wanna see it.
 hello? hi.	 hi. anybody know a good tailor?
needs some clothes altered?	no, no, i'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
why don't you go see frankie? my family's been goin' to him forever. he did my first suit when i was 15. no wait, 16. no, 'scuse me, 15.  all right, when was 1990?	okay. you have to stop the q-tip when there's resistance!
i know you did. i'm just gonna deal with it, i'm just gonna deal with it. i gotta get out of here.	ok, i don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
you know, i think i was sixteen.	what stupid thing did you do?
well, i sorta did a stupid thing last night.	what stupid thing did you do?
honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.	people do stupid things when they're upset.
 ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.	well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, i've got pants that need to be altered.
hey, chandler, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello. he'll know what it means.	are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
how long do you want the cuffs?	at least as long as i have the pants.
look, rach, rach! i've been with my share of women. in fact, i've been with like a lot of people's share of women. the point is, i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.	 yo, paisan! can i talk to you for a sec? your tailor is a very bad man!
 hey, what's goin' on?	joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years.	oh come on! he said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
what?	cupping.
thank you. my hair is very amused.	come on, monica, things could be worse. you could get caught between the moon and new york city. i know it's crazy, but it's true.
thank you.	that's ok.
hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...	that's ok.
i guess so.	you know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. i'll be right back.
 what are you guys doing?	we're just hanging out by the spoons. ladle?
carol?	carol? i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
chandler?	so, uh, how often can you do it?
what a bitch.	hey, sweetums.
 hi, honey.	hey, sweetums.
it's gonna be a problem, isn't it?	come on, you're going to bloomingdale's with julie? that's like cheating on rachel in her house of worship.
duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. ok.	what did you just do?
what is the big deal?	what did you just do?
no, no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it. i just, i just don't think breast milk is for adults.	of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
 gimme a box a juice. well, they switched me over to hombre.	well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. you should see this guy, chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.	 what do you care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
i know, but, i was the best, you know? i liked being the best. i don't know. maybe i should just get outta the game.	 all right, say you do that. you know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. and then where're you gonna run?
yeah i guess you're right.	you're damn right i'm right. i say you show this guy what you're made of. i say you stand your ground. i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
i'm gonna do it.	all right. now go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
so how was joan?	i broke up with her.
come on, they were not that huge.	i'm tellin' you, she leaned back, i could see her brain.
hold it hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one. when i first moved to the city, i went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest adam's apple. it made me nuts.	you or me?
you name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.	maureen rosilla.
all right, bye-bye.	ok, janice. janice. you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky.
ok, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building. go into the light, mr. heckles!	ok, phoebe.
well, it's not so much that you know, like i don't believe in it, you know, it's just...i don't know, lately i get the feeling that i'm not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed.	uh-oh. it's isaac newton, and he's pissed.
have you ever seen so much crap?	actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
huh. so now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?	hey, look at this. my big book of grievances.
hey, there's me! april 17th. excessive noise. italian guy comes homes with a date.	april 18th, excessive noise. italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. well that's excellent.
check it out, check it out. heckles' high school yearbook.	wow, he looks so normal.
heckles, you crack me up in science class. you're the funniest kid in school.	funniest? heckles?
that's what it says.	wow, heckles was voted class clown, and so was i. he was right. would you listen to that?
i'd call that excessive.	whoa!
what?	heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet. and he was in the scale modeler's club, and i was, well, there was no club, but i sure thought they were cool.
so, you were both dorks. big deal.	i just think it's weird, you know? heckles and me, heckles, and me, me and heckles...would you knock it off?
have you been here all night?	look at this. pictures of all the women that heckles went out with. look what he wrote on them. vivian, too tall.
chandler, heckles was a nut case.	our trains are on the same track, ok? yeah, sure, i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. bitter town. aloneville.
all right, you know what we gotta do? we gotta get you outta here. come on, i'll buy you breakfast, let's go.	what if i never find someone? or worse, what if i've found her, but i dumped her because she pronounced it supposably?
chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.	how do you know that? how?
i don't know, i'm just tryin' to help you out.	you'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and i'm gonna end up alone. will you promise me something? when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
well, i don't know. i don't know what we're gonna be doin'. i mean, what if we're at her folks' place?	yeah, i understand.
you can come over and watch the super bowl. every year, all right?	you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this. i'll see you man.
supposably. supposably. did they go to the zoo? supposably.	 hi, it's me.
janice? you called janice?	yes, janice. why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
you remember janice, right?	yes. she was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. janice is my last chance to have somebody.
helloo! !	oh, my, god!
hey, it's everybody.	janice, you're--
yes, i am.	is it--?
is it yours? ha! you wish, chandler bing. you are looking at a married lady now.	congratulations.
oh, sweetie, i'm sorry.	you couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
hey chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp.	neat. i'm gonna die alone.
chandler, you're not gonna die alone.	janice was my safety net, ok? and now i have to get a snake.
uh huh. why is that?	if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. so i figure i'll be crazy man with a snake, y=know. crazy snake man. and i'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run.
you have got to get over this. you're not gonna end up alone.	of course i am. i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then i bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
wait a minute, wait a minute. yes he is. you are totally different.	in a bad way?
you are ready to make a commitment!	whoa! don't know about that.
that's fine.	hey. well, you will all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night. this woman, alison, from work. she's great.
hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?	i'll take that.
you want his yearbook?	yeah, yeah. some people said some nice things about him. i think somebody should have it.
it's really not that big!	takin' that with you, huh?
you comin'?	yeah, jus' second. good-bye mr. heckles. we'll try to keep it down.
oh, my major was totally useless. i mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see philosopher wanted?	sure.
you are dead meat.	i didn't know it was a big secret.
what!	i didn't know it was a big secret.
you have a third nipple?	you bitch.
whip it out, whip it out.	c'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
yeah, show it. show it. the nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.	joey was in a porno movie.
huuh.	if i'm goin' down, i'm takin' everybody with me.
so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?	why yes ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of narnia.
you know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. you get the best huts and women dance naked around you.	huh? are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
the ice capades?	no, no the gravel capades. yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when snoopy falls. . .
[holding cream pitcher] oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of chandler's chest and flips the lid] hey chandler, would you fill me up here?	oh i see, i see, because of the third nipple thing. ha ha ha ha. . .
yeah?	sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. but, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.
so is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.	ok, now wait a minute. that is the craziest typing test i've ever seen.
shh, ok, here i come, here i come. see i'm comin' to fix the copier, i can't get to the copier, i'm thinkin' what do i do, what do i do. . .	nice work my friend.
that saves us a conversation.	well, listen, this has been great but i'm officially wiped.

now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?	i'm goin' home.
man, i sure miss julie.	spanish midgets. spanish midgets wrestling. julie. ok, yes, i see how you got there.
you ever figure out what that thing's for?	no, see, i'm trying this new screening thing. you know, i figure if i'm always answering the phone, people'll think i don't have a life. my god, rodrigo never gets pinned.
hello, i'm looking for bob. this is jane. i don't know if you're still at this number, but i was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, i know it's been three years, but, i was kinda hoping we could hook up again. i barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what i did?	what?
i got a little drunk...and naked.	bob here.
oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new james bond poster.	can you hold on a moment? i have another call. i love her.
i know.	i'm back.
so, are we gonna get together or what?	um, absolutely. uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? do you know uh, central perk in the village, say, five-ish?
great, i'll see you then.	ok. ok. having a phone has finally paid off.
even though you do do a good bob impression, i'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not bob.	i'm hoping that when bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
oh my god. you are pure evil.	ok, pure evil, horny and alone. i've done this.
 hi, julie.	ok, while ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? you know, like from, like 20?	hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
do we need a cake?	look guys, i know it's a little steep.
yeah, whoosh!	but it's ross.
all right.	i'll see you guys later, i gotta go...do a thing.
ok, sweetheart, i'll call you later tonight. whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?	you know, i think i might just.
i'm tellin' you. you can't do this.	oh, come on. i can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
that doesn't matter. she wanted to call bob. hey, for all we know, bob is who she was meant to be with. you may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.	we don't know bob, ok? we know me. we like me. please let me be happy.
go over there and tell that woman the truth.	all right.

hi.	listen, i have to, uh, um, i have to, i have to confess something.

how did you--?	i don't know. i just had this weird sense. you know, but that's me. i'm weird and sensitive.
thanks.	no, you keep the pack. i'm all cried out today.
what are these, like famous chickens?	hey, sorry i'm late. congratulations, mon. i'm not sorry i'm late. how incredible was my afternoon with jade?
well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. hey, chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?	oh, see, i had to tell her that my number was your number, because i couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is bob's number.
um, i'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.	i will have the uh, cajun catfish.
anything else?	yes, how 'bout a verse of killing me softly. you're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
no, huh uh, no way, i'm sorry, not gonna happen.	whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
yeah.	you can tell us.
i hear ya.	we can talk about that.
that's a good point.	so um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
g-gift? the thing's not the gift?	no, the thing was, we were gonna go see hootie and the blowfish.
all of us.	together.
yeah.	so, the ebola virus. that's gotta suck, huh?
but wait, there's more. hey, chandler, what is in the envelope?	by the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
come on.	why, it's six tickets to hootie and the blowfish! the blowfish!
i don't, i don't understand. i mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.	if you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. maybe that's just how you feel.
oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.	why did you look at me when you said that?
fine.	fine.
chandler!	yeah?
geez! are you ready?	yeah. just let me grab my jacket and tell you i had sex today.
whoa! you had sex today?	wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. i was awesome, ok? she was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
wow.	now i know it's been awhile, but i took it as a good sign.
still doing the screening thing?	i had sex today. i never have to answer that phone again.
hey, bob, it's jade. listen, i just wanted to tell you that i was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, i ended up meeting a guy.	bob here.
oh, hi.	so, uh, you met someone, huh?
yes, yes, i did. in fact, i had sex with him 2 hours ago.	so, uh, how was he?
eh.	eh?
oh, bob, he was nothing compared to you. i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.	well, that makes me feel so good.
 bumpy?	well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. and uh maybe you have to get used to it.
yeah, i know, it's my birthday. we all should be here.	so, let's go.
well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.	yeah, i mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
excellent, that was excellent.	i can't believe the guys missed this.
ross.	chandler.
uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.	yeah, we really missed you guys.
you partied with hootie and the blowfish?	yes, apparently stevie and the band are like this.
it's work.	i don't know what to say. i'm sorry that we make more money than you. but we're not gonna feel guilty about it. we work really hard for it.
 yeah, hi, it's monica. i just got a page.	i'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
and you feel like we hold you back.	yes.

 lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.	you know, i don't think we brought enough stuff. did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
it's gonna be worth it. it's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? women love guys who love babies. it's that whole sensitive thing.	no, i got him.
no, seriously.	oh, seriously you want him?
and who is this little cutie pie?	well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?

no, you are not, you are very attractive. you know what, i go through the exact same thing. every time i put on a little weight, i start questioning everyting.	woah, woah, i've put on a little weight?
chandler, i'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. ya wanna work out? i can remake you.	oh, you know, i would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.
c'mon. let her. yeah.	alright, ok, alright. but if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, i'm goin' home.

ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? what?	nothing, except tell you, uh, i think it's wonderful how much energy you have.
well, thanks.	i mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
well, you know.	you know, i mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.
[sad] uh-huh.	and it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
well no, but um.	i mean, if it were me, i think i'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.
y'know, i try to stay positive. . .	so, you feel like goin' for a run?
alright.	because, you know, you don't have to. if you want, you could just take a nap right here.
ok. just for a little while.	ok. [puts an afghan over her and dances into his room]
wow. what are you gonna use it for?	[doggedly] games and stuff.
i don't know what to do. what am i gonna do? i mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.	oh, i know. this must be so hard. oh, no. two women love me.
hey, here's a thought, ross. [reaches for the computer]	don't touch the computer. don't ever touch the computer.
can't we just use a pen?	no, amish boy.
and i guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. and i've seen her be a little too into her looks. oh, and julie and i, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but rachel's just a waitress.	waitress. got it. you guys wanna play doom? or we could keep doing this.
oh, her ankles are a little chubby.	ok, let's do julie. what's wrong with her?

oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [chandler jumps out of the car]	[chandler gets in the back seat] hey!
ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, joey and chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]	oh, so that's what this is for.

yeah, yeah, no it's ok 'cause, i mean, i know he's there, so, that's enough for now.	hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry christmas everyone. [ross and phoebe hug, monica and rachel hug, chandler is left standing]
no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.	ok, phoebs, your turn.
you got me a cola drink?	and, a lemon lime.
well this, this is too much, i feel like i should get you another sweater.	and last but not least.
here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was joseph tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.	ok, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. phoebs, read yours.
ok. [reading] the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...	does anyone have one from a different paper? ross, read yours.
i had one glass.	i had about a mugful in this lovely 'i got boned at the museum of natural history' mug.
hey.	guess who's back in show business.
ohh, ohh, lorne green?	no, no, phoebs. you know why? cause he's dead.
oh, no.	ok, i guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... joey, that's who.
oh, well, we have to celebrate. you know what we should do? we should do, like, a soap opera theme.	hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.
oh yeah. see you guys. [leaves]	bye..... ridiculously dull bobby.
hi.	[turning around] hey ross.... bahhhh!
alright.	[to phoebe] listen, phoebs, this is gonna be ok. [introducing russ and ross] ross, russ. russ, ross.
oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.	you know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose ross, we have a spare.
[upset] she's dating. she's dating.	yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
see what? i don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. and it takes him, what? like... like... i don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.	yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
hey.	whoa, whoa, so i'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, italy called and said it was hungry.
well, the part's mine if i want it.	oh my god!
yeah, if i'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.	[not knowing how to react] oh my... god?
ten years i've been waiting for a break like this chandler, ten years! i mean, days of our lives. that's actually on television.	so, what're you gonna do?
well, i guess i could sleep with her... i mean, how could i do that?	well, i... i've got a pop-up book that told me everything i need to know.
i've never slept with someone for a part.	well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]
sorry.	it's alright. is she good-looking?
yeah, she's totally good looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar, or something, i'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] you know, after having slept with her.	y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. y'know, i mean, the way that i see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. y'know, i mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got christmas.
i just... i just don't think that i want it that way though, y'know? i mean, let's say i do make it, alright? i'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the little general.	didn't you used to call it the little major?
[condescendingly] dysprosium? try mendelevium.	and weenie number two has it. unless, of course, nine-down, knights in white satin was sung by the doody blues.
you could not be more wrong. you could try... but you would not be successful.	ok, i'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
did joey say what he was gonna go when he left?	no, i don't even think he knew. hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
i don't know. who would i have to sleep with?	me.
why would i have to sleep with you?	it's my game. you want the job or not?
[holding bottles] does anybody want these?	i'll take one. sometimes i like to hold stuff like this and pretend i'm a giant.
it was unbelievable! i walked in there and she was all over me.	so what'd you do?
hi.	oh, hey.
i guess you guys heard, rachel dumped me.	yeah, i'm sorry man.
hey.	hey!
if you wanna call that a reason.	[singing to the tune of mister rogers' neighborhood] who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? hi, neighbor.
no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself.	whoa, she's pretty.
it's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. so while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.	oh, ok.
i'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.	nice!
excellent!	for a minute there i thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
all right, all right. damnit braverman, it's right there on the chart!	that's great. all right, i gotta get to work, i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
no no, that's me.	oh, yeah.
oh my god.	that's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
god, this is so hard. i can't decide between lamb or duck.	well, of course, lambs are scarier. otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks.
oh, i believe i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.	yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
if you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.	believe me, sometimes that happens.
well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?	you know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. but in your case it's actually kinda true.
that's him.	damn. my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
all right people, we're in trouble here. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. move, move, move!	monica, i feel like you should have german subtitles.
all right, look, ross. i realize that you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you, i do. but if you don't help me cook, i'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and i'm gonna create a new appetizer called pigs in ross. all right, ball the melon.	hey! how come i'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
it just seems so futile, you know ? all these women, and nothing. i feel like superman without my powers, you know? i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly.	well now you understand how i feel every single day, ok? the world is my lesbian wedding.
i miss rose.	oh, yeah?
i got one. which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [they all look at chandler]	isn't ben in this?
remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.	yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat. . .
hey, hey, check it out, guess what i got.	rhythm?
well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in l.a. so i figured i'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel.	you know i think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?	well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. [both laugh hysterically]
never mind, it's open.	[joey grabs a frying pan] yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. we might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. ready?	wait, wait, wait. [opens the top of the dish soap he's holding]
i can't believe joey's having lunch with his stalker. what i-, what is she like.	well, you remember cathy bates in misery?
yeah.	well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
and she's not crazy?	oh no no no, she's a total wack job. yeah, she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake remore.
ah, and i mean, he's going out with her? he can not persue this.	hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. i mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? what're you lookin' at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
excellent!	very informative!
well, i guess i'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.	that's what i did when i lost my clydesdales.
and then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]	and you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]
this is so exciting, i haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.	what, you never look down in the shower? oh please. i'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
woah.	[to guys wering yellow isolation suits] so, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
i hate actors.	[to an extra in fatigues] nice camoflauge man, for a minute there i almost didn't see ya.
excuse me.	ahhhh.
uh, is your name chandler?	uh, yes, yes it is.
chandler bing?	do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
it's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.	oh, right, well yeah, i graduated fourth grade and realized i wasn't a pimp.
remember the class play? you, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.	yes, back then i, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. thank god i don't do that anymore.
ok, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?	ok that's not what he was doing. alright, he was looking for his bus money.
oh that's me, i gotta go.	oh uh, o, ok.
um, so listen, how many times am i gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.	well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say ernie's, 8 o'clock.
i'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time i'll get to see your underwear.	no one was around to hear that?
stick a fork what?	like, when you're cooking a steak.
oh, ok, i don't eat meat.	well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.	ok, then, eat me, i'm done.
what did you say?	ahh, i believe my exact words were, 'flaign,en - sten'. i mean i didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.	oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what i had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
but um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?	well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my aunt edna's, and there were three of us in there.
well i was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.	you want me to wear your panties?
could ya?	well, if i was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . you're swell.
how you doin there squirmy?	i'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
how come all i can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?	because i went to an all boys high school and god is making up for it.
i want you right here, right now.	right now, right here. don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa [susie grabs him under the table] they do have the shrimp.
meet me in the bathroom. [she leaves for the bathroom]	i'm going to the bathroom now. [leaves for the bathroom]
c'mon.	i can't believe we're doing this.
alright mister, let's see those panties.	alrighty. [we see chandler's pants drop from under the stall door]
ooh. ooh. but ya know what would be even sexier?	what?
if you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.	oh.
alright. now i would like to see you wearing nothing but them. take your clothes off.	ok, but uh, i hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
c'mon hurry, hurry.	hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
alright, turn around. time to see you from behind.	ok.
oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.	well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... susie? susie.
this is for the fourth grade.	huh? where, whaddya mean?
whaddo i mean. whaddya mean, whaddo i mean? i mean underpants, mister, that's what i mean.	what, what's what you mean?
my skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. i was susie underpants 'till i was 18.	that was in the fourth grade. how could you still be upset about that?
well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. [she leaves with his clothes]	alright, i hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
ma?	joey!
chandler? what're you still doin' here, i though you guys took off.	oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.
are you naked in there?	not exactly. . . i'm wearin panties.
huh, you uh, you always wear panties?	no, no, this is the first time.
wow, talk about your bad luck, i mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.	i was not trying them out, susie asked me to wear them.
well, let me see.	no. i'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.
what? let me see. [climbs up in the other adjoining stall]	no, no, you don't have to see.
hi tushie.	alright, one of you give me your underpants.
can't help you, i'm not wearing any.	how can you not be wearing any underwear?
oh, i'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.	alright look ross i'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
yeah. oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. hey, chandler, can i borrow your g-string?	how long you been waitin' to say that?
hey.	hey. hold on a second. [shoots a goal] huh?
eight hundred and twelve bucks.	well, i don't know what big leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. what is this for?
heh, what d'ya say?	i don't know. it's a bracelet.
isn't it? and it's engraved too, check it out.	[reads] to my best bud. [puts it back in the case] thanks best bud.
put it on.	oh, now? [puts it in his desk drawer] no, no, i think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. [sets a chair in front of the drawer]
oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] you put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on chandler] ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.	i so am.
you have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?	well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once i get used to the extra weight, i'll be back on track.
oh really? what uh, what does he want with her?	well, i'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love.
because she's your lobster.	oh, she's goin' somewhere.
oh ok. well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? you feel guilty and tense around them already. you might as well make some money off of them.	ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]
what is that sparkly thing?	that thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
do you want a refill?	no, i'm alright, thanks.
ok. ooh, ok, you gotta give me a second, i wanna get this just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her best male voice. . .]	[walks over to the woman] i know what you're thinking, dave thomas, founder of wendy's.
i'm gail.	chandler. [waves his arm around, exposing the bracelet]
it's not that bad.	oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the mr. t collection. [joey walks in behind chandler]
if you hated the bracelet so much, chandler, you should have just said so.	well, doesn't the fact that i wore the bracelet even though i hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?	ok, well that's the part where i'm a wank. but i was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [joey goes to his room and shuts the door] hey, c'mon man, i said i was sorry like a hundred times, i promise i will never take it off my. .
would you stop already? get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.	oh, you're right i, i should play in the hay. forget about the fact that i just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that i hated to begin with. bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]
hey now you have two. [chandler looks annoyed] oh, now you have two.	what am i gonna do, huh? [joey walks in behind him]
hey.	hey.
how come you have two?	well this one's for you.
get out.	no, i can't. no no, listen, i, i know how much this means to you and i also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.
wow, is this friendship? i think so. check it out, we're bracelet buddies.	that's what they'll call us.
oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. i was uh, a little bigger then.	oh, i thought that's what they used to cover connecticut when it rained.
they had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum.	ok, i was wrong, that's what they used to cover connecticut.
shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.	ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
this summer?	work on your music?
alright, no peeking. no peeking, no peeking, no peeking.	alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when i open my eyes.
alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen tv]	sweet mother of all that is good and pure.

[sits down] ohh yeah, that's the stuff.	[reaches for the footrest lever] do we dare?
i can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch tv with your feet up.	well they were chair-shaped cows. they never would have survived in the wild.
hey you. [they stand together in front of the tv.]	woah, hey, yo. [rachel and ross move]

hi.	hey.
that was 14 hours ago.	so how'd it go?
oh. listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?	yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
yeah. i don't know, i've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. and i just want it to be perfect and right and. .	it's the miracle wax.
hi you guys.	hey.

what?	the spoon. you licked and-and you put. you licked and you put.
yeah, so.	well don't you see how gross that is? i mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [joey gets a sheepish look] you used my toothbrush?
well, that was only 'cause i used the red one to unclog the drain.	mine is the red one! oh god. can open, worms everywhere.
hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?	because soap is soap. it's self-cleaning.
i can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.	excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
um, i'm getting a lily for my mom. 'cause her name's lily.	wow, that's lucky. what if her name was big ugly splotch?
ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. rich is gonna be here any minute.	oooh, rich is goin' to the party too, huh?

alright, you want the truth? i'm thinkin' about it.	what?
i'm sorry. i'm 28 years old, i've never lived alone, and i'm finally at a place where i've got enough money that i don't need a roommate anymore.	woah, woah, woah. i don't need a roommate either, ok? i can afford to live here by myself. ya know, i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
what're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? it's not like we agreed to live together forever. we're not bert and ernie.	look, you know what? if this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.

you got a problem with that?	no, just wanna make sure we're on the same page.
hi. [ross turns to rachel and they hug]	ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] oh no, wait a minute, i have no one.
hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back.	na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
this couch belongs to us.	alright, i'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's tie]	don't play with his things.
the guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.	you had to ask.
well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.	i think you played the gunther card too soon.
how come it's not mixing with the water?	well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
[walks out of his room] hey, this is ridiculous. i'll tell you what. after i get back from my neice's christening, i'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. no problem, joey's there.	ok.
no.	no?

no. so what. so what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.	well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? ya know, because i think actually mine's growing back.
well we did it, we're here. we are standing our ground. how long does a cup of coffee take?	would you come on! come on! [waitress brings their coffee] thank you.
i think we proved our point.	you burn your mouth?
yes, and that's why we're here.	yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
it's a nice watch, i don't wanna break it on your ribs.	alright, let's do this.

no, you can't use your watch.	ok. [reaches in his pocket]
or your keys.	ok.

joey they're not real. i start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. see [squeezes her breast] honk honk.	wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
cause she uh, she steals stuff.	or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and joey just slept with her and never called her back.
agh, it was the graduation from hell.	ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
well, how bout just her mom?	why her mom?
ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.	excuse me?
i'll never remember all of that. so uh, what's the deal? rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?	this isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
chinese menu guy. forgot the menus.	so, basically just a chinese guy.
you thought i was rachel?	yes because uh, you look so young.
oh, i missed you kids. well, should i put my coat in the bedroom?	no! no, i'll take that for ya.
so uh, joey and chanlder, i, i think it's time that you take dr. greene over to your place.	uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. why again?
right this is staging.	yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] alright that's ross.	ok, they're coming, shhh. [runs into monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]
both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?	well, we could count again.
that's who.	look, are you gonna be ok?
well, i have to be, i don't really have a choice, i mean, you know, i could look at the bright side, i get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.	well, actually just one birthday flan.
what?	it's a traditional mexican custard dessert...look talk to monica, she's on the food committee.
quick volleyball question.	volleyball.
yeah, we set up a court in your room. uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?	joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, i'm not even listening to you.
dennis.	ok, that's me. [runs back]
this is it, isn't it? i mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. my mom there, my dad there. thanksgiving, christmas.	well, i relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
ya know, i just, so weird. i mean i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july.	becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
it's just this thing. every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. my sister jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong.	i, i know. [hugs her. ross walks out and chandler puts her in his arms.]
i'm getting ready for the water skiing. [mr. greene opens the door which pulls ross in] how are you doing?	well, uh, dr. greene, where are you going?
ok everybody, it's time for flan.	yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
oh, i ordered mine first.	yeah, but i'm, i'm so much faster...
give it to me.	no.
give it to me.	ok, you can have it. [he licks it and offers it to her.]
[she grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] there you go, enjoy your coffee.	that was there when i got here. [takes a bite of his muffin.]
had it.	had it.
but don't you need experience for a job like that?	it's not that hard to learn. and as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
[enters] hey chandler, here's this morning's projections.	hey thanks. scott alexander, joey tribbianni. joey is a uh, fellow processor.
uhh, well, right now i'm in between things. you know how it is. one day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.	i was just telling joey about the opening in fleischman's group.
hey.	hey, how's the first day goin'?
pretty good. it's like you said. it's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.	well there you go.
hey and everbody is so nice. i just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, jeannie.	jeannie, the head of east coast operations jeannie?
yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. small world huh?	weird world. your kids?
i figure my character has kids.	ya know there isn't a part of that sentence i don't need explained.
well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. my character, joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, ashley and brittany. ashley copies everything brittany does.	well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
yeah. joseph and his wife, karen, are thinking of having a third kid... ya know what? just did.	really? wow. that's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
what a phony.	well, i'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. hey mr. douglas.
uh, listen bing, i received your memo. so, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next friday?	well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
yeah bing, what's that about?	it's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, i can get them to you by wednesday.
have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday.	uh, if you say so sir.
joseph's good, isn't he?	well, i'm going to kill you.
hey, hey, i just figure joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.	why?
hey. mr. douglas is looking for you.	why? wh- wh- why is mr. douglas looking for me?
'cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project.	wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
becasue at first he thought it was joseph. but after he asked joseph about it, turns out it was you. anyway, i just thought you should know.	alright, that's it. look joey, i'm sorry, i realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if i could just fire joseph, i would, but unfortunately that's not possible so i'm gonna have to let both of you go.
what're you talking about, everybody loves joseph.	i don't, i hate joseph, ok. i think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
oh yeah. well you can't fire joseph. you know why, 'cause he's not in your department.	alright, ok, alright. so i can't fire joseph but uh, i can sleep with his wife.
really?	no freakshow, she's fictional.
take it easy. if it means that much to you, i'll uh, i'll go find something else.	thank you.
yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. see, i, uh, had to kiss this guy.	'cause he was just so darn cute.
over my dead body!	and i'll be using his dead body as a shield.
ooh-oh! someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. someone get a little action?	i may have.
what's she look like?	well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
woo-hoo, geeek!	i like this girl, okay, i seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes i tend get a little defended and quipy...
please!	well she totally called me on it, okay. she said, 'cut it out, get real', and i did.
wow! what's that like?	it's like this, me, no jokes.
could not be more terrified.	well, i think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give rachel another chance to dress up like princess bubble yum.
come on, chandler, i want this part soo much. just one kiss, i won't tell anyone.	joey, no means no!
hey!	i'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
so how's your date with your cyberchick going. ooh, hey, what is all that .	oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the guggenheim  museum. see, she likes art, and i like funny words.
what does she mean by hh?	 it means we're holding hands.
are you the cutest?	i'm afraid i might just be.
you know, what i think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. it could be a guy.	okay, it's not a guy, all right, i know her.
oh, well. just ask her how long she's gonna live. women live longer than men.	how do you not fall down more?
okay, ask her 'what is her current method of birth control?'	all right. my husband is sleeping with his secretary. she's married!
well at least we know she's a woman.	i can't believe she's married.
aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. she wants to know what's wrong?	what's wrong? what's wrong? you're married that's what's wrong.
oh, my.	what?
she wants to meet you in person.	hey, look, phoebe i wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
what if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. i mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.	okay, i'll do it!
chandler, relax, chandler, she'll be here.	 ooh, oh, oh, that's her.
chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. it's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. i think what you have to do is try not to...	oh my god!
did not, she did not wink at you....	huh.
morning, hey, you made pancakes?	yeah, like there's any way i could ever do that.
 good morning.	hey, you know what, here's a thought. why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
oh, i wish. look, honey, you have that report to finish, and i gotta go see my lawyer.	i can not believe that i am going out with someone that is getting divorced. i'm such a grown up.

look, what do you want me to say?	i want you to say that you like her!
i can't. it's like this chemical thing, you know. every time she starts laughing, i just wanna  pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her.	thanks for trying. oh, and by the way there is no count rushmore!
women tell each other everything. did you know that?	umm, yeah.
no chandler, everything! like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....	girth? why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. do you wanna?	we're not gonna talk about girth are we?
nooo!	yeah, okay.
yeah?	yeah! all right! you go first.
okay, okay, i'll go first.	okay.
so, uh, the other night rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies, and i happened to describe a particular star wars thing....	princess leia in the gold bikini.
yes!	i know!
yes! wow, well, that-that was easy. okay, you-you go.	okay.
okay.	okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
hmph.	and, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. and you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like elle macpherson, or that girl at the xerox place....
with the belly-button ring? oh, muhawa!	i know, and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head. and your like 'mom, get outta here!' you know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. so it's kinda like, you're, you know.
your mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your mom, what is the matter with you?	you said...
hey!	what are you guys doing together?
joey and janice's day of fun!! !	really.
i just came by to give you a kiss, i have to go pick up the baby, so. i'll see you later sweetheart, you too chandler.	you still can't stand her can you?
i'm sorry man, i tired, i really did.	well, you know, i appreciate you giving it a shot.
but, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and i survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. it was bat day at shea stadium.	well, i guess that's something.
no man, that's huge! now, i know i can stand to be around her, which means i get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.	okay.
oh, hey, chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross.	oh god!
hey, if it makes you feel any better, i do it too.	really?
all right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.	taste it.
 yep, it's fat. i drank fat!	yeah, i know, i did that two minutes ago.
 hey!	hey, mister tux!
well, you know, i'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.	okay.
ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.	 all right, i took the quiz, and it turns out, i do put career before men. get up.
what?	you're in my seat.
how is this your seat?	'cause i was sitting there.
but then you left.	well, it's not like i went to spain. i went to the bathroom, you knew i was coming back.
what's the big deal, sit somewhere else.	the big deal is i was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
you guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. so..	all right, ross, i just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. get up! !
uh, no. wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. nevermind.	well, joey, i wrote a little song today. it's called get up.
all right! you can have the chair.	really!
what if it's new? i mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. shouldn't i call him back?	honey, you did call him back. 'cause, it's, it's really old.
i.....got.....dressed. really, really quickly. okay, okay. there we go, there we go.	you know what, okay, fine. don't get up, you just sit right there. i just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. op, not touching, can't get mad!
ah! oh my god! you r-r-rotten boys!	sorry phoebe.
okay, thanks. yeah, i'll try that.	maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
noo! no!	all right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. i'm soooo, comfortable.
me too. in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable.	all right!
okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. okay, chandler, i want you to go and change! okay. and then, when you come back, joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair.	all right! fine! i'm going. but when i get back it's chair sitting, and i'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
well, who's voice was that?	maybe it was his sister's. you know, maybe it was his daughter's.
yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. all right, come on, i'll just pick something out for you.	all right, you will notice that i am fully dressed. i, in turn, have noticed that you are not. so in the words of a. a. milne, get out of my chair, dillhole!
okay.	what are you doing?
you said i had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.	the cushions are the essence of the chair!
that's right! i'm taking the essence.	oh-ho, it'll be back. oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
no honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. i love you. i love you.	we used them as pillows when we went camping.
what?	 the sheep.
whoa, whoa, whoa. come on, come on, what. you took his underwear?	he took my essence!
it's a rented tux. okay. i'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.	well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
okay, you hide my clothes. i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.	what are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
hey, opposite, is opposite!	he's got nothing!
rachel, didn't have anything that i liked, so, but she had this christmas ribbon, and i thought, 'all right, fine i'll be political.'	what are you supporting?
it was, it was her voice.	monica, i think you've gone over to the bad place.
 uh, michelle. yeah, that was me, i-i dialed your number by mistake. oh, you're so sweet. yeah, we were a great couple.	 you know what's weird. donald duck never wore pants. but whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. i mean, what is that about?
okay, fine.	they got a phone in there, right?
 get away from that! no! she's just getting dressed.	is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?
okay, buddy-boy. here it is. you hide my clothes, i'm wearing everything you own.	oh my god! that is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear! !
look at me! i'm chandler! could i be wearing any more clothes? maybe if i wasn't going commando...	oooo-ooh!
okay, okay. enough, enough with the lunging. no! i'm sick of this.	jeez, what a baby.
you, give him back his underwear! i'm gonna go get a cab, and i want everyone down stairs in two minutes! monica! 	stop it. stop it!
let's see what else he'll do!	stop it. stop it!
 well, i have to tell you, i was quite impressed with your paper on pre-cretaceous fossils. yeah, it confirmed everything that i have written.	excuse me. hi.
yes?	well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
what do you mean, your seat?	i mean, i was sitting there.
but, you got up!	but, i never left the room!
but, you left the chair area.	all right, that's it, give me your underwear.
 whoaa! !	 see joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
hey.	hey.
nooo. i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out.	well, i'm sorry joe. i didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
hey, how come we never have jam at our place?	because the kids need new shoes.
monica's making jam.	because the kids need new shoes.
hey.	do i look fat?
hey.	do i look fat?
noo.	okay, i accept that. when janice asked me and i said no, she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow.
okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.	okay, well. janice said 'hi, do i look fat today?' and i, i looked at her....
and it works both ways.	okay, so you both just know this stuff?
okay, for instance. let's say, janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim.	that's easy, baggage claim.
 wrong! now you're single. it's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her.	okay, this is good, this is good. all right listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know i'm all for. but, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.
good luck chandler.	thank you rachel.
 okay the sleeping thing. very tricky business, but there is something you can do.	well, i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
noo! no, not cuddlily, not me, just her. i'm like you, i need the room. okay, come here.	yeah.
i'm gonna use the cushion.	yeah.
okay, you're in bed. she's over on your side, cuddling. now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. and then you rollll a-way.	okay, the old hug and roll.
yep.	okay, one question.
shoot.	you're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
okay, first i'm not crazy. and second, say it don't spray it. anyway his name is malcom, and he wasn't following me, i mean he was, but 'cause he thought i was ursula, ick. and, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.	umm, not feeling better 'bout malcom.
aww. ohh!	hey, joe, i gotta ask. the girl from the xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. so, i've got a new plan now. babies.	well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with, if i have to wait another 28 years then, i'll be 56 before i can have a baby, and that's just stupid.	that, that's what's stupid.
night-night bing-a-ling.	night-night.....janice. 'look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. that would be weird though. okay, hug and roll time.
 okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! okay, he's 6'2, 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male geena davis.	you mean there's more than one of us.
hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?	and that's how you bought it?
when did you go to a sperm bank?	and that's how you bought it?
what, he's not still following her. do you think he is still following her?	pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
 hey. uh, chan, can i uh, can i talk to you for a second?	sure. what's up?
are you intrigued?	you're flingin'-flangin' right i am!
there is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. meet the milk master 2000.	you're flingin'-flangin' right i am!
hey.	hey, man. what's up?
maybe you can tell me. my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today. the first good thing she gets me in weeks. how could you not give me the message?	well, i'll tell ya i do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.
 'annie! hi. listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office?	is anybody else scared?
 'right, well look, um, if joey loses this audition, that is it for estelle. i don't care! annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' i need a pen.	get the woman a pad! get the woman a pad! a pad! a pad!
i'm sorry, it just felt nice.	 joe. joe! answer the phone.
hey, i only got one good arm, you know. you should be doing stuff for me. go get me a sweater.	just do it! okay, it's janice and if i get it i'm going to have to see her tonight. oh, that's great i'm gonna have to see her tonight.
what's the big deal? why don't you wanna see janice?	okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
and that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?	noo.
you didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.	no, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. and this alarm started going off in my head 'run for your life! get out of the building!'
what is it with you people! i mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?	i know, that,  that's why i don't want to go tonight, i'm afraid i'm going to say something stupid.
hey, you know about that? !	look what do i do? i wanna get past this, i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. i wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
 where there is no fear of commitment.	do we have any... do we have any thoughts here?
amazingly, that makes sense.	you think?
oh, yeah. go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	yeah, joe, i assure you if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun, i'm pretty much peeing every which way.
so, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?	'cause, i wanted to uh, give you this.
ohhh, are you a puppy! contact paper! i never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.	well, wait there's, there's more. see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
oh, you didn't have to do this.	yes, i did. yes, i did. because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
well, i gotta buy a vowel. because, oh my gawd! who, would've thought that someday, chandler bing would buy me a drawer.	well, not me. but that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. we should take a trip.
we should?	yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. and, i wanna meet your parents. we should take a trip with your parents!
 i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! are you okay?	i am, i actually am. i mean this is amazing. my entire life i have feared this place, and now that i'm here it's like what was the big deal. i could probably say 'let's move in together.'
you probably want us to move in together?	it doesn't scare me!
yeah, well, it scares me! i mean i not even divorced yet, chandler. you know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. and, and i wasn't even that hungry.	oh, no, no, no, don't go! i've scared ya'! i've said too much! i'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!
honey, this will help.	so, i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
that is never good.	then i got all needy and clingy.
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it?	she said she'd call me.
ohh!	oh god.
welcome to our side of the tunnel.	this ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
yeah, you do.	so, you don't think i'm terminal?
well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.	okay, okay. so, should i call her?
right. so, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. and then act aloof.	so i'm not, not gonna lose her?
oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.	i said, 'so i'm not gonna lose her?'
 no, thank you. chandler!	 hello, janice.
what are you doing here?	 oh, just a bit of shopping. how've you been?
are you being british? !	 no. not anymore.
why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood. were you here waiting for me?	yeah, huh. i'm just uh, you know i'm just picking up some things for a party.
barley? what kind of party serves barley?	well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
where is this party?	here in chelsea.
who's party is it?	a woman's
what woman? !	 chelsea.
okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. so like which of these two guys do you want to be?	can i be that guy?
my god! chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.	i've actually ruined this haven't i? it's time for the good ice cream now, right?
you know what, everything's gonna be okay.	 hello. hi, janice! can you hold on for a second? okay.
yeah.	hello!
yes, and grumpy.	what are you, stop naming dwarves! hello, janice. hi, i'm so glad that you called, i know i've been acting a really weird lately. and, it's just because i'm crazy about you, and i just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times.
he's soo lucky, if janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.	 i love you too.
hey!	hey-hey-hey. so what happened? a forest tick you off?
no. y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.	yeah!
well, i started building one. but then i decided to take it to the next step.	youre building a post office?
no, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. its a one day job, max.	okay. my word! those are snug.
no, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.	all right, janice, likes him. in fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.
her what?	well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad.
so, chandler, whos on your list?	ah, kim basinger, cindy crawford, halle berry, yasmine bleeth, and ah, jessica rabbit.
now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your league?	i know, i know, i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
hardy boy.	peter parker.
well i-i-i, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. first, ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories....	 what a geek!
chandler.	hi.
hey, how do you guys get anything done?	we dont, really.
yeah, i was thinking that maybe we could go down to time square and pick up some ninja stars. and, oh, um, my friend larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.	you know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.
oh, im sorry. did i get ya?	no, you didnt get me!! its an electric drill, you get me, you kill me! !
calm down, do you want this unit or not?	i do not want this unit! !
well, you shouldve told me that before, im not a mind reader. hey, were out of beer. im going to monicas.	fine!
yeah, its hard okay, i only have two spots left.	all right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
okay, elizabeth hurely....	oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
susan sarandon.	eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
and!! isabella rosselini.	ooh-hoo. very hot, very sexy. but ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
so?	so, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
which you just gave up really quickly.	 have you seen joey?
whats the matter?	oh, just this! yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
 hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.	whats going on?

well, how-how-how is that possible? you barely know her!	i don't know. i can't--i just, i can't get her out of my head. y'know? i mean, i'm a very bad person.
we were just talking about you.	really? !
hey.	really? !
yeah-yeah, i told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.	 right in there!
 hey!	hey!
listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and kathy tonight?	ohh, umm, y'know what, i already ate.
it's 430.	y'know i had a big meal on monday, y'know. so that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
okay, i see what's going on here.	you-you do?
yeah! you don't like kathy.	you got me.
yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. look, i made an effort to like janice, now i think it's your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out to dinner with us. right?	yeah. right.
good, and hey! my treat. but that's only because you're not eating anything, right?	okay.
so? huh? what do you think?	ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
is she great or what?	ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
not your type?! she's gorgeous!	y'know what i think it is? it's the fishnet stockings. y'know? whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
okay. understanding a little more why you're single. ohh! y'know, i have a friend you would like, she's really pretty.	uhh, no-no thanks.
okay, i've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.	listen, i-i'm gonna grab a beer.
what was that?	what?
kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. i thought we had a deal.	hey, look, what do you want from me?
i want you to like her! but if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.	i am pretending.
well then, do it better!	okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her? no-no it'll be good, i can tell her much i've been thinking about her. that i haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her. that i'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
hey what are you guys looking at?	ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
probably the only time i'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?	where did you, when did you, how did you...  how did you get a girl like that?
actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.	okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
oo! is it for my birthday present?	phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?	well, i have a call in about that.
'kay.	actually, this is for kathy's birthday. it's an early edition of her favorite book.
oh, the velveteen rabbit! oh my god, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!	okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
huh. well, then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair. so this is pretty rare. how did you get that?	oh, it wasn't a big deal. i just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
yeah, and what a great way to say, i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!	it doesn't say that. does it?
how do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange?	okay, all right, i'll just uh, make sure that uh, joey gets her something really great.
ahahaha... haha.. yes i can, of course. excuse me.	it's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. hey joe! what are you getting kathy for her birthday?
you know what we should all do? go see a musical.	 sure...
and you know which one we should see? the 1996 tony award winner. do you happen to know the name of that one?	i don't know... um, grease?
no....	rent?
yes! rent!	okay, so when do you want to go?
 hey. man, it is so hard to shop for girls.	yes, it is, at office max.
what did you get her?	a pen.
it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock! huh?	huh-huh! you can't give her that.
why not?	because she's not eleven! and it's not the seventh night of hanukkah!
sure it is! she needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... whoa! it's time for my date with joey!	all right, look, look. what did... what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday?
she didn't have a birthday while we were going out.	for three years?
 look, it's too late, and i got an audition. i can't shop anymore! i...	all right. i will go out and i will try to find something for her, okay?
thanks, man. and oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?	would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
any luck?	oh, yeah. yeah, i found this great place called invisible things for kathy. can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
all right, look. why don't you just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. like... a regular pen.	she's really going to love this, you know? the bottom line is i want her to have it, even if i don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
aw, honey, that's so sweet.	yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic?
 hey! i'm meeting kathy in ten minutes! i've been looking all over for you!	where?
our place, the hall! i...	i got something for her. it's a book!
 a book? is it like a book that's also a safe?	no, it's a book that's just a book, okay? it's an early edition of the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite book as a kid. so, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
you got it. thanks man. thanks for doing this, i owe you one. oh, hey!	no, it came out to an even twenty.
hey!	hey, how'd it go? how'd she like the gift?
oh, man, she loved it! she's over there showing monica and rachel right now.	oh yeah? that's great!
hey, listen, i gotta tell ya, i feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am i gonna get a lot of credit for this!	[nodding, with mixed feelings] aahhuuhhh....
hey!	hey! happy birthday.
you know, uh... [joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] chandler got you a gift, too.	no he didn't. [moving it back.]
yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! ha-ho-ho!	happy birthday! i'm sorry.
you really didn't have to. wow.	see, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
yeah. no, this is great. thank you, chandler. .	oh, yeah... yeah.
oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .	[to kathy] goodnight.
um, thank you for the gift.	oh, uh, yeah... i just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
no, i... i didn't mean the pen. thank you for the book.	uh, the book?
the velveteen rabbit. i kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.	what do you mean?
well, uh, when joey gave it to me, he said, this is 'cause i know ya like rabbits, and i know ya like cheese. thanks. i love it. and i know how hard it must have been for you to find.	 uhl..ell. by the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, uhl, ell.
you must really like... joey... to go to all that trouble for him.	oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
well....	goodnight.
y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise.	it just keeps getting worse and worse! y'know? i mean its bad enough that im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, i think she knows. because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us.

yeah-yeah. and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself!	wait! youre going out with kathy!
yeah. why are you getting so upset?	well, im upsetfor you. i mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
what is the big deal? its not like were exclusive.	look, joey, kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. but casey, i mean granted i only saw the back of her head, but i got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.

i picked her! oh thank god you want her! ooh!	wow! why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. come on, lets trade!	oh thats not true! thats not true! i got her that backpack and she loved it! i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  oh, there was no big dog.

who cares? he works in a museum!	hey, what time is it? the big game is about to start!
you dont have to do that, ross and joey arent here, you can watch the parade if you want.	thanks.

yeah, well maybe phoebe will switch with me.	oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
oh, thats not true! ive got her lots of stuff she never took back.	like?
like uh, that gold necklace i got her last year.	when was the last time you saw her wear it?
well, she wore it all christmas day, and then uh	big dog?

ewwwww!! ew! ew! ew!	 sounds like a really bad idea to me.

well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy.	yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
thats a good idea for a business!	im totally screwed. okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. y'know itll be like, so wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, chester? and shell go, no-no-no, its chandler.
 that-that is a good trick.	all right, look, look, what am i gonna do?
well okay, so then youre fine. the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. okay? so as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.	really?
yknow what, i dont know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.	yeah, i know but
no-no, stay right there. gettin closer.	okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. which im fairly certain are the same thing.

its a good play, isnt it?	oh, i loved the play. you were great, and nick ditto. clearly youre having sex with him.
clearly, im having sex with him?	oh come on, it was so obvious! there was no chemistry between you two!
okay, so let me just get this straight. youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?	yknow, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing.
acting! chandler, this is my job! im-im playing a part in a play! how can you not trust me?	well, you can understand, given how we started.
oh, wow. i cant believe youre throwing that in my face.	well, that is what happened, and i dont even see you denying this!
ill tell you what, chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up!	yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon!
oh, are we gonna trash that place?	steps! slut! you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy!
so you were right?	i confronted her, and she didnt deny it! i dont live here!
are you sure?	well, i may be drunk, but i know what she said! then i went over to beefsteak julies
beefsteak charlies?	yes! see you and i have always been like
no, sorry.	all right, maybe i should call her.
hes right, what she did was unforgivable.	well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if i was wrong?
how might you be wrong?	well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy?
dude, tell me she actually told you this.	she did not have to tell me, i saw the play, and there was no heat. back me up here, ross!
thats all youre basing this on?	thats not backing me up! look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.
whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. the lone gunman. communism.	oh my god! !
 hey.	hey. i just, i just wanted to come over to-to say that im sorry. yknow? i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and i can completely understand why you were so upset.
oh wow. i really wish youd call me.	yeah, i know, i-i wish i had too, but yknow i-i think this is a good thing. y'know? cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on. yknow, i know for me nicks pants?
yeah.	yeah. well, i think our second fight is going to be a big one!
howd it go?	well, she wasnt sleeping with him.
oh good!	she is now.
what are you saying?	im saying that she is a devil woman! yknow i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick! nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! i hate him, i hate her!
how? how is your fault?	because, i-i shouldve called! yknow if i had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. i threw her at his man nipples!
great!	you dont have to stop having fun just because im here. kathy didnt cheat on all of you. well, except you.
yeah.	 would you give me one minute!! please.

whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! wait-wait!	pheebs! we have to take you to the hospital now!
i can't believe phoebe's gonna have her babies!	i know, it's beautiful. amazing.

ooh, it's not bad.	okay.
oh! and so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!	hey! you okay?
hi! phoebe, i'm dr. harad, i'm going to be delivering your babies. i want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. i've been doing this for a long time.	did he just say, he loves fonzie?
that's what it sounded like.	all right
uh, delaware. she's on her way though, so until she gets here, i'm gonna be your coach. but don't worry, she told me all about the la-mazada stuff.	yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. maybe they're with them.	really? male nurses?
yeah, i was bummed too.	so they're going on dates? when?
let's see what we got here. ohh, y'know, fonzie dated triplets.	this-this fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
oh no-no-no. fonzie is the nickname of arthur fonzerelli. the fonz.	all right.
umm, listen there's something i think you should know.	oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? yeah, joey already told me, and i am so-so fine. i mean, you and i we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
umm, actually i was about to tell you that i was, i was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe i will go out with him.	fine! maybe i will too!
hello dan! i'm really looking forward to saturday night! really, really!	so dan, nurse not a doctor huh? kinda girlie isn't it?
nah that's okay. i'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.	oh.
and it didn't feel so girlie during the gulf war.	sure. and listen, thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
oh, great!	 hey, how 'bout it? you, me, saturday night?
no.	all right. very good.
uh, bye monica.	bye, momi-moo.
yesssss!!!!! we got a baby boy! !	yes!
chandler's a girl!	oh god, kindergarten flashback.
they musta read the sonogram wrong. 'cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but chandler's a girl! chandler's a girl!	okay, keep saying it!
great!	so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
well uh, you and i are just goofing around, i thought, why not goof around with him.	y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am so bad at this.
i think you're better than you think you are.	really? okay, so
 know when to stop.	y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?
yeah. all right, i'm gonna go tell dan that it's not gonna happen. don't do the dance.	right!
yeah. you won't be able to take it.	so uh, now that little chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
they're gonna call her chandler.	that's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
ross! way to suck up to the family.	 ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. i'm so glad you guys are all here! my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
 hey!	oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! no-no, vomit tux!
okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, i was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. so, i just thought that it'd make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street, 'cause they were so nice when i was a little kid! no one ever wrote back.	well y'know a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.
so chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend?	uhh, yeah. she uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
ohh, he's really shy. i-i dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.	yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
i dont care! i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!	really?! that's what you heard? you said that?
i might've said that. why is that funny?	because i'm very happy for him! and you, you lucky dog!
well, emily's willing to work on the relationship.	yes!
i will find a selfless good deed! 'cause i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right!	 hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question?
sure!	if you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard?
well, y'know i-i-i think i'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.	why?! i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, i'd be going like this.
so i asked emily if she would come to new york, and she said yes.	yes!
i told her i'd have to think about it. i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision? i'm actually asking you!	well, you can't just not see rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
yeah.	that's true!
yeah, but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.	that's true!
oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?	hey, there he is! there he is!
 now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! who cares, y'know? now i got the legs	how many times have i told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
 hi chandler.	hey!
uh, listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day.	oh that was yours? uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
william sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.	expect it in 4-6 weeks. umm, hey, umm, joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
yeah, so?	well i just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
y'know what, champ? i think i'll pass.	why?
why?	what's your point?
keep talking.	i mean i was nothing before you. call the other girls and ask. which wouldn't take long. but when i'm with you, and we're together, ohmygod.
really?	oh-aw my god! now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. we're too good! we owe it, to sex!
well, if we owe it? oh my when is joey gonna be home?	well, i was kinda hoping we could do this without him. oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
but, i just cleaned the bathroom.	yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
yeah.	all right, let's show them how it's done.
ow!	y'know that wasn't part of it?
never done that before.	nope.
 hi!	 hi!
monica? what time is it?	uhh, 9.
i'm really getting tired of sneaking around.	i know, me too. hey! y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
all weekend? that's a whole lotta naked.	yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!	okay, y'know your not though. let's go.
oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like chandler's conference could've been in connecticut or vermont.	i'm not in charge of where the conference is held. do you want people to think it's a fake conference? it's a real conference.
damn!	what's going on?
hi!	uh, hey!
what's going on?	we're flipping monica's mattress.
oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?	aww, man!
can you hear anything?	oh yes, somebody just said, can you hear anything?
ooh, madlibs, mine!	condoms?
you don't know how long we're gonna be in here! we may have to repopulate the earth.	and condoms are the way to do that?
ooh, chocolates on the pillows! i love that!	oh, you should live with joey, roll-os everywhere.
come here. okay, be right back.	oh yes! monica, get in here! there's a high-speed car chase on!
we're switching rooms.	 oh dear god, they gave us glasses!
no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. come on sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can't we?	okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
i think you'll find this room more to your liking.	okay, great.
 they say he's only got half a tank left.	half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
we're switching rooms again.	what? why?
excuse me, umm, can i talk to you over here for just a second?	uh-huh.
our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.	uh-huh.
chandler!	 yeah.
look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and i'm not gonna let 'em! and we're not a couple of suckers!	i hear ya, mugsy! but look, all these rooms are fine okay? can you just pick one so i can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
okay, this one i like!	 nothing! it's over! dammit! this is regularly scheduled programming!
can we turn the tv off? okay? do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?	oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!	oh, who should i blame? the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas!	do not speak ill of the dead.
we're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?	i just want to watch a little television. what is the big deal? geez, relax mom.
what did you say?	i said, geez, relax monnnnn.
hey, you're back!	hey.
how was your conference?	it was terrible. i fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. are you kidding with this?
oh, so your weekend was a total bust?	uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.
i guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.	well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
hey, how was your chef thing?	well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
chandler!	monica.
okay, i'd like to know how much the room was because i'd like to pay my half.	okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars? !	yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i couldn't do it.	yeah, me either.
hi, rach.	hi!
oh no! not that guy! he does look like him though.	okay, ross is in the bathroom.
who's kip?	kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
 do you even know who kip is?	kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
hey, mr. bing. that uh, hotel you stayed at called. said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.	yes that was mine.
'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.	yes that would have made more sense.
hi.	i just came over to drop offnothing. so that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
yeah, it did.	so, i guess this is over.
what?	well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
why, exactly?	because of the weekend, we had a fight.
chandler that's crazy! if you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanohhh!	so, this isn't over?
 you are so cute! no. no, it was a fight. you deal with it and move on!	really? okay. great!
ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!	 we're in a relationship?
i'm afraid so.	okay.
 oh! ohh! oh! !	joey, can i talk to you for a second?
ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! !	yes. yes.
you?! 	it happened in london.
how?! when? !	it happened in london.
in london!! !	the reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
but it is a big deal!! i have to tell someone!	no-no-no-no-no! you can't!
i guess i'm done.	fun's over!
look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it.	aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
well, i'm sorry if i'm not a middle-aged black woman! and i'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition! okay, look, if i have to pretend i don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.	okay.
sorry.	sorry.
hey!	hello!
yeah! why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all! plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!	yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. that didn't happen, i made that up!
look, if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york, i'm sure everything will be fine.	okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
oh, i hate this. everything's changing.	yeah i know, we're losing ross, joey said hence
ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! enh? all right, what do you think?	you're on in 5 ms. minnelli.
that's way uptown! that's like three trains away! which is great! i love to ride that rail!	so you're really okay with this?
yes! yes! i mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, i'll get so much done on the commute. i-i've been given the gift of time!	now that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space. we should get them together and make a continuum.
 i know i miss you too. i can't wait to see you. i love you. bye.	okay, what is in here? rocks?
no-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.	so, rocks.
yeah!	look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
i kinda feel like it's my fault.	kind of? if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!	well, i think it's very brave what you said.
all right, i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places.	pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?
look, ross, i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk.	yeah, we are so sorry.
hi emily!	hi!
she's there? !	oh yeah, there-there she is!
no, look.	that's a pig.
i know, i know, but look at the knobs on her.	hey!
emily's cousin kicked me out!	what? !
well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.	how can he do that? didn't you sign a lease?
hey, you can stay with us! we'll take care of ya!	oh, yeah! absolutely! anything you need man! but you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
what?	he thought you said gonad.
 hey roomies!	love what you've done with the place.
not a problem. and listen, hey! since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'ti was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.	oh yeah!

ahhhhhhhhhh	 hello children!
hey! wanna play some foosball? please?	okay.
all right, i have one question. what is the deal with this?	bye-bye little puppet joey hand?
no, the quiet down thing!	you mean this.
um-hmm! look, i-i-i don't know how much more of this i can take! did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with some show about bugs! my god!	 all right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is ross! i survived college with him!
all right, i guess i can hold out a little longer. let's have a game.	okay.
 uh fellas,	okay, so he's out of here.
well, i guess i can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.	not even on page 7?
 oh yeah! you'rehey, you're right! here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!	what about that circled one?
but it's available now! isn't it?	yes, it is.
okay!	there we go!
oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, i was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? i mean after all, we all are using it.	let's go quicker.
oh my god!	yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. well that's great! y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
but hey, ross, this place is available now!	yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
how about you?	it's a kitchen slash bathroom.
oh, it's perfect!	it's a kitchen slash bathroom.
all right, i see what you guys are saying. i'll uh, i'll go downstairs and fill out an application.	we are bad people.
maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping ross get back on his feet!	yes that was a nice place!
yeah!	not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!

i'm sorry. it's just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever.	no-no-no! i am the king of bad thanksgivings. you can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
oh, come on! i wanna hear it! it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out!	it's a tradition, like the parade. if the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
i don't know about that. i've got one that's worse.	really? worse than, more turkey mr. chandler?

boy, i love carrots! oh! sometimes i like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while i talk to you. umm, and-and-and y'know if i get really hot umm, i-i like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, i-i put the cold steal against umm,  my body.	are you all right?
you brought a carrot.	what?
it's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.	without my toe?! i need my toe!
i didn't mean to cut it off. it was an accident.	that's why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot? !
i'm sorry! it wasn't your whole toe!	yeah, well, i miss the tip! it's the best part. it has the nail.
chandler, i said i was sorry.	yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! i hate this stupid day! and everything about it! i'll see you later.
oh wait, chandler, come here is there anything i can do? anything?	yeah, just leave me alone for a while.

oh-oh, yeah-yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier!	well, yeah actually.
we'll try to be more careful okay? it's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.	i know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
we are! help us!	help!
hey, phoebe!	hi, pheebs!
umm, wethering heights. i'm taking a literature class at the new school and i have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.	i didn't know you were taking a class. that is so cool.
someone at work ate my sandwich!	well, what did the police say?
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich. i can't believe someone ate it!	ross, it's just a sandwich!
 that-that would be incredible. thank you so much. i-i still can't believe someone ate it!! i mean, look, i left a note and everything.	 knock-knock. who's there? ross geller's lunch. ross geller's lunch, who?
really?! so what would you say pheebs? stuff like uh, keep your mitts off my grub?	say ross, when you picture phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie?
joey, is what she just said ummoh my god. you were actually gonna	what is going on here?
we're so sorry.	yeah.
well, i'm telling everyone about you! that's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!	no-no, wait! there's got to be a better explanation. you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.
yeah, i like that. but no-no, how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place?	ohi don't know.
hey. okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, i thought that i would give you just a little preview.	 you're naked in this picture!
i know.	ross?
on account of my rage.	which i may say, right now, is out of control.
wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?	and you're okay with that?
joey has got a secret peephole!	 oh no! no! no! no!
no! i am not a pervert! okay? it's just i just kinda	all right, look! look. i think i can explain this.
thank you!	joey's a sex addict.
 i slept with monica.	well let's.let's see what everybody thinks of that?
my god monica! !	are you sure joe? are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
ohh, no, no. were not going to just sit. shhh.	 hello, chandler bing.
 hello mr. bing...i love you.	 alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! its been six months! its not funny!
but, i love you.	leave me alone! for the love of god, leave me alone!! !
hey you guys, guess what?	the british are coming?
 yeah, i already have my bell and later on...i get my bucket.	ohh.
hey, how do you spell suspicious?	why?
because i think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.	yes! chandler bing, 7! chandler bing, 0.
you're driving me crazy with that!	okay, i'll stop.
well, you suck! but at least you suck at a man's game now.	you wanna play?
chandler, i can't be playing games, ross is gonna be home soon. and i have to write five whole pages if i'm gonna stick to his schedule.	well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
 all right! but uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?	i'm intrigued.
all right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.	okay, but be careful okay, because i wanna get our security deposit back.
yeah, i think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.	do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.	 oh yeah, it's great! see you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidop! op!
i didn't finish my five pages.	well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
joey's not going.	well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.	 why don't you cut him a little slack? okay? maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
dude, if you think fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.	the only reason you're doing this to joey is because you're bored. okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend. and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.	oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
how about we settle this right now! there! now, no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha!	i paid for those tickets!
no you didn't. you said you would, but you never did!	oh yeah!
oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.	when did that happen to you? !
don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picturei didn't have my camera!	oh yeah. first off all, chasing the churo guy isn't jogging.
oh, great!	okay, bye! oh my god! !
yeah, wow, sorry rach.	i don't believe they're brother and sister.
yay!	great! now, we can go to the ranger game! last night!
i guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. huh?	yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the live long day! !
yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that i finished it. and uh, i think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if i could hear it. so would you guys read it for me?	all right.
hey man.	what is up?
about yesterday, i was really wrong. i am sorry.	no, it was me. i'm sorry. i over reacted.
maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest  but we had our best friend's interest at heart.	could i be more sorry.
i'm sorry.	 i'm sorry too.
 i am sorry, chandler.	i am sorry, ross.
a handsome man enters. hey! how's it going guys? i don't know what you two were talking about, but i'd like to say thanks to both of you.	this took you all day? !
all right! here we go! 1999! the year of joey!	 we're very happy for you.
what's the matter? !	we wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know
 3! 2! 1! happy new year!	 happy new year!
just the one divorce in '99! y'know what, i am gonna be happy this year. i am gonna make myself happy.	do you want us to leave the room, or?
ooh! that's a good one! mine is to pilot a commercial jet.	that's good one too, pheebs. now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
in fact, i'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. eh, y'know what, better yet? a week.	i'll take that bet my friend. and you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day! and it starts right now!
hey!	hey!
i'll see you tomorrow.	hey!
i just asked that girl out.	nice!
yes it is. see.	 elizabeth hornswoggle?
that's right, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.	horn-swoggle.
you all right chandler? is there something funny about that name?	no. no, i just think that maybe i-i'd heard it somewhere before.
ooh, this must be killing you.	what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.
okay, lesson one chords. now, i don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, i-i-i made up names for the way my hand looks while i'm doing them. so then, this is bear claw. okay, umm, turkey leg and old lady.	what an interesting approach to guitar instruction. y'know some might find it amusing, i myself find it regular.
auntie monica! !	 ross is wearing leather pants! does nobody else see that ross is wearing leather pants? someone comment on the pants!
i like them a lot.	that's not what i had in mind! see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants. you see, they're very tight. maybe there's something in that area.
i never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.	oh come on! !
 i can't wait to be with you! i'll sneak over as soon as ross picks up ben. i'll just tell rachel i'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.	 laundry. huh. is that my new nickname?
okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, i think i'm, i'm gonna go do my laundry.	oh yeah, me too. y'know if this shirt is dirty. yep.
 what? oh!	sorry man.
oh, thanks gunther. stupid british snack food!!!!!! !	did they teach you that in your anger management class?
look at us all dressed up for the big office party! by the way, what are we celebrating?	oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the christmas party.
i think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. we don't have to hide.	i know, i can do this.
hey bing! wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?	i asked myself that very question, sir. uh,  this is monica. this is my boss, doug. doug this is monica.
say uh, bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us?	no, sir.
what was that?	what?
that noise you just made?	oh, that was my work laugh.
really? your work laugh?	oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
all right, check me out.	okay.
really?	and! they like me more just because i was with ya! i think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met joey. and doug wants us to play tennis with them.
hey, i thought you already had one.	oh i used too, but then joey thought it would be fun to go to central park and hit rocks atbigger rocks. hey rach, do you have a tennis racquet?
oh umm, y'know i lent it to joey and i never actually got it back.	okay, good luck with that.
am i on fire today or what?! those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!	okay, easy martina. i think we should let them win the next game.
i'm sorry, i don't understand what you just said.	let them win one.
are you crazy?! we own those two! i mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills.	you're not even giving them a chance!
uh bing, i think we're gonna make this the last game.	oh yes, sir! put me out of my misery. are you sure you never played pro? please let them win!
i'll take it down to 95% but that's the best i can do.	oopsey, missed it!
i got it! !	long!
i can't believe you let them win!	yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
i was frustrated.	it was my racquet.
i was frustrated with you!	if we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
y'know what really bothers me? isit's how-how different you act around them! i mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the i'll see you around, bing! not if i see you first, doug!	okay y'know what, because you said that, i'm not putting out tonight.
oh, none for me. thanks.	just a little bit of sugar.
how does that laugh not give you a headache?	oh, you get used to it.
well, maybe i'll bring it out and have monica stick her finger in it. that oughta sweeten it up, huh?	oh, you get used to it.
y'know, i-i-i don't think that i can. so if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.	so i laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
i'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when i can be hanging out with my boyfriend who i actually respect.	oh.
 uh, i gotta apologize for kara's coffee. y'know, i feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself. did you hear what i said bing?	what?
the joke bing. what's the matter with you?	well, i-i just didn't think it was funny sir.
excuse me?	well, i just
 honey, i just don't think that you understood the joke.	really?
yeah! i mean it was really funny, i-i just don't think you got it. you see kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? but-but what doug was-was imply that it was weak physically.	i think i do! thank you, monica.
i thought you could use the help.	coffee in a fight!
sorry! i'm justi'm not very good at this! i'm a terrible liar and i hate having to lie to rachel!	but we're not ready to tell yet!
'kay. congratulations on your new job.	man, she is really gullible.

i just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and i hope this isn't too weird, but uh, i had uh, a thing with janice. what you're-you're not mad?	why would i be mad?
well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. you don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.	 i am mad! but you know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna forgive you! because that's what friends do!
okay.	i also want you to remember that i let you live here rent free!

and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.	very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
umm, chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head.	wh-wh-why? !
well, because she loves you and because you love her.	yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean? !
hey, chandler, don't freak out! i'm telling you something you already know! come on, she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies. and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's monica.	i don't see it that way. okay? because, i see two monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica, who i just started to date. now, who's to say what she wants?!
no, you're right, you are absolutely right. i mean that makes, that makes everything different.	okay. it's not different at all, is it?
isn't this great?	hmm.
couldn't you just stay like this forever? chandler! couldn't you just stay here forever?	yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
are you okay?	yeah, i'm cool. casual.
what-what are you doing?	i'm just hanging out. y'know, having fun. y'know with the girl that i'm seeing casually.
man, i knew it! i knew you were going to do this! !	what? !
get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.	well, you do want all that stuff, right?
oh and you know what i want!	yes! you want babies! you have baby fever!
i do not have baby fever!	oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! i've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker? !
have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me! this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!	nah-uh! i know you! okay? i know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
you don't know everything. did you know that i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm? and did you know that the only baby around here is you?!	well, i did not know that.
oh yeah, yeah, sure. absolutely.	by me?
gunther, can i get a coffee  to go?	monica.
i'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.	just tell me what i need to do to make things right.
what? !	well, that's what we do. y'know, i-i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think i'm all cute again.
 i'm monica.	i need to talk to you, it's urgent!
okay.	okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. and uh, well i guess there's only one-one way to do this.
wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing? !	 monica
no-no, don't-don't-don't do it!	will you marry me?
chandler, why are you doing this?	i don't know. but i know i'm not afraid to do this.
chandler.	i'm doing this because i'm sorry?
do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?	no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. will you be my wife?
 chandler, umm, i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.	yeah, i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
honey! do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now!	yeah i know, but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys.
y'know what? y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? well, you're not ready for that.	i didn't think i was!
oh my god, what would have done if i said yes?	well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love. or, you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door.
oh no wait pheebs, i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure, chandler?	okay, how long is this going to go on.
this is fun. hey rach, remember that whole we were on a break thing? well, i'm sorry, will you marry me?	that's not funny.
hey!	hey!
what are you guys doing up?	oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
 dark red.	yeah, i think that's wrong, but there's a connect the dots in here for you later. hey, how about maroon?
all right, i'll see you in the morning.	okay.
wow!	oh that's so cool! why would a cop come in here though? they don't serve donuts. y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again?
 hey, you guys!	hey!
what's with him?	oh, y'know what? the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
i know but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds.	okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you could get arrested.
 hey! oh.	hi, joe.
nothing!	oh, come on! you've been acting strange all day!
all right! there is something. i kinda had a dream,  but i don't want to talk about it.	whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if martin luther king had said that? i kinda have a dream! i dont want to talk about it.
well, it involved monica.	you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing?! oh, that is so cool! i can't tell you how many times i've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. anyway we're talking about your dream.
no!	no, it can mean anything. like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud.
um-hmm.	joey, look, are you attracted to monica? right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
 not really.	well there you have it!
no, i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. y'know? i mean, yeah, i can get a girlfriend! yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?	well y'know, monica and i were friends before we started dating. so maybe-maybe that's it?
 hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?	oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
well, i brought the next best thing.	 hey!
chandler?! you brought chandler?! the next best thing would be monica!	y'know, i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so
no! that's-that's my arm!	 oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
okay!	okay.
all right, ready?	yeah.
turn.	 okay.
turn! turn!	okay, i don't think we can turn anymore!
oh yeah it will! come on, up! up-up-up! up!	shut up! shut up! shut up! !

all right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.	okay, yeah, i think it's really stuck now.
i know, me neither! i mean, you had a sketch!	oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
yeah, yeah, i met this woman.	 hey, whoa-whoa! what's she like?
 all right! hey, who wants pizza? !	ooh, i do! i do! i do!

okay. and don't worry, i'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.	 he has a gun!
oh no, it is okay, i mean as long as you know that chandler and i are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! i mean our flame, whew, is on fire!	 hey monica, here's your broom back.

come on, we can't let them win!	ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! okay? so why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing? !
because phoebe and gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!	 so?
i feel really sad that we're notreally there anymore.	oh wow! is that what this all have been about?
wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?	yeah that was great. that was really great! but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are right now.
really?	yeah! i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, i think that's pretty incredible. and the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah i think that's pretty exciting.
that is so sweet. i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm, i feel the same way.	yeah?
yeah.	y'know what i just realized? you just freaked out about our relationship.

hey!	hey!
wow! you look nice. what's the occasion?	monica and i are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at ja george.
wow! how'd you get in there?	made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 1130 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
hi chandler!	hey caitlin! somebody got a haircut.
ugh, i hate it! i look like an 8-year-old boy.	yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
it's uh, 27 dollars even.	oh, okay. here you go.
hey, where's the chicken?	oh, he's in the back. the duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
 great. i'll see you later!	okay, bye!
what the hell was that? !	what?
the flirting! aren't you supposed to be going out with, i don't know hmm, let's say my sister? !	i was not flirting.
it was totally flirting. somebody got a haircut	okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. and second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. that is all.
yeah, right.	you wanna see flirting? i'll show you flirting.
don't get me started on that.	i was not flirting.
chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!	i was not and oh god, shh!
well	is that what this is about? you like caitlin?
this is so cool!	so, joey on law  order, you must be very proud!
chandler, she doesn't understand a word of english.	i'm sorry, i thought you were joey's other grandmother. i've done it again.
 hey! happy anniversary!	happy anniversary, 10 months!
so umm, when i was in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london	uhh, joey's grandmother is right there.
is that the one that speaks english or the one that doesn't?	the one that doesn't.
that was some hot love you gave me! i'm gonna go get ready.	hey, why don't you wear those earrings i gave you?
that's a great idea! i was saving them for something special.	okay.
oh umm, my big scene is coming up. big scene coming up.	if you said, big lima bean, bubbling up. would she understand the difference?
y'know, all i'm looking for is the money.	here you go. now stop bringing us pizzas you.
i'm gonna try.	you're welcome.
you couldn't let me have her, could ya? !	what?
chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!	thank you for that! i was not flirting.
really? !	really? !
it's no big deal, i do it all the time.	 so umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
sure! it doesn't mean anything! just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you!	okay, but there is a big difference. you are a lot hotter than i am.
chandler, this actually bothers you?	yes, it does bother me! and i think it would bother a lot of people. rachel, when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
and not the one on the menu!	 well, what is it?
 okay, everybody just keep smiling. it'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.	 well, what is it?
 joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault.	 if we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
no, it's sam waterston! crimes and misdemeanors, capricorn one.	doesn't know, hello. but she knows capricorn one.
yeah, it's good.	see, i'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the law  order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri-state area!
chandler! okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.	oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up. look, i'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.
go on, teach me something about men and women.	okay, i've already taught you so much already, but whatever. see when you flirt with a guy you think, i'm just flirting, no big deal. but the guy is thinking, finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me!
no way!	it's true.
well that's pathetic!	again true.
and this goes for all guys?	all guys that are awake. then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
joey!	uh, joey is gonna be right back. right back! meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. so, you're old and small.
 oh, mine! mine! mine! okay, here goes.	okay, hold on. okay.
gas? wow! intense.	 if this is the way all the gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.

really?! you?	yeah.
well, it's kinda dangerous.	well, i like danger.
yeah! !	tonight? you-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
 that was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.	it is starting to get dark out there.
yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.	 okay. but it is officially nighttime.
even though my tax dollars paid for this car.	your tax dollars?
yeah, you can't eat that in my car.	your tax dollars?
did i say you could smell it? !	i can't smell your sandwich?
half the taste is in the smell! you-you're sucking up all the tastiness!	okay, i'll give them back. look! what is so great about that sandwich?
okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.	okay.
are you thinking about monica?	yeah.
this witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.	sur-surprise him? we're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
hey, i'm more cop than you two!	how do you figure that?
hello! i'm in the front seat, okay? i'm gary's partner!	y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. it, it sounds gay.
oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.	 oh, hurry up. i want to sign that.
is everything okay?	what's going on?
uh-huh. thank joey!	uh, hello! !
my god, joey!	 it was a car backfire!
hey joe, you ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you.	who jumps at loud noises!
wow! i could've died tonight.	yeah! if the car that backfired had run over you! y'know what, i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
i do have a newfound respect for life.	 oh my god!
dude! how come you took off?	oh, i just went for a walk, around the living room. whatever
is something wrong?	no. no i'm just tired. y'know, from-from the walk.
okay.	you dove in front of ross! ross!
that's what this is about! oh my god, you hate ross!	i do not hate ross!
of course you do! i saved him! you're mad at me! it all adds up!	what picture?
i don't know, but i don't like what i'm hearing!	look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
ohh, you're upset because you think i chose ross over you! no! iknewyou could take care of yourself. y'know, i mean ross, he need help.	when it comes down to it, you would risk your life for ross before you would for me. that's the bottom line.
well, no, not exactly! all right, look, i, i wasn't trying to save ross. okay? my sandwich was next to ross.	from a bullet!
i know it doesn't make much sense	much sense? !
look chandler, it was instinct! okay? i just went for it!	so you risked your life, for a sandwich!
i know it sounds crazy, but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!	so you didn't uh, choose ross before me.
no! i would never do that! you-you're like my brother!	really? !
yeah! in fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.	thanks.
how good is that?	 oh-oi-ho, yeah!
see?	hm-hmm.
oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing? !	i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
man, i would be great in a war! i mean, i really, i think i would make a fantastic military leader. i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys.	before or after you were shot by your own troops?
i know where joey would be. he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.	yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
i'm fine, thanks.	 yeah, see, i can't pull of baby-doll can i?
no. i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. i'm gonna get some tea.	okay.
i can't believe this!	 right, because it's fast. because, it's so fast. it's fast!
relax! it's phoebe! not you!	oh! good for you pheebs, way to go!
no, i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready for this!	so, what are you gonna do?
i don't know. i'll just handle iti'll ask you to talk to him!	me?! why me?
because you are so afraid of commitment! you talk to him, make him scared like you! make him aman!	i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? because i'm a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be.
that is so sweet!	 still terrified, i'll take care of it. no problem.
hey chandler, what are you doing here?	gary, i'm here to report a crime.
yeah?	it is a crime that you and i don't spend more time together.

sure. okay.	uh, are you crazy? are you insane? if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!
yeah, i-i considered that. i just know it would make me happy.	you mean scared.

listen chandler, the way i see it is that i was lucky enough to find someone that i really love. i justi wanna be around her as much as i can.	wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
so you know what i'm talking about, right?	yeah, i think i do! y'know what? you move in with her! you move in with her right now!
no, it's too soon for you guys.	 yeah, you're right about that.

you wanna eat? my treat!	isn't that ross's money?
yeah. okay. ross's treat! where do you wanna eat?	i don't know.

okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?	too dry.
do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?	no!
is this movie gonna be my big break?	no!
 what? !	yes.
dude you said, no!	i also said, yes!
you don't think this is going to be a big break for me?	no! ahhh!! !
i don't believe this!	look joe, i just, i just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
what are you talking about?! i'm the lead in a movie!	they're not even paying ya! this doesn't even sound like a real movie!
y'know what? i don't need this! okay? i don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.	joe, i don't think this is going to be your big break.
is that why you're on this trip, huh? make me feel like a loser? 'cause if it is, i'll tell ya, i-i-i'd rather be alone.	oh, you don't want me on the trip?
not if you're gonna be like this!	all right, i'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that i'll lie.
yeah! i don't want you on the trip!	all right, fine! fine! why don't you pull over? i'll get out right now!
fine! get out!	you're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
get out! !	all right!! wait! wait, there's no sidewalk! yeah, i'm gonna die here.
eh! stop it!	 hey!
hey!	joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge!
why? !	i don't know! he went crazy! y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
that game should not be played without my supervision.	well, i don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? all i said was that uh, i didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
what's in the bag?	oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me. so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road. who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
oh that's my grandma. and thanks joey she's having a really great time.	 is that joey? is that joey? let me talk to him! i wanna talk to him!
okay joey? chandler's here, he was wondering  okay, i guess he ran out of change.	y'know, he won't even talk to me. how am i going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
well, maybe you should send him something. so that when he gets to las vegas he'll know that you're sorry.	that's a good idea. i wonder where i could  get a basket of porn
no, don't-don't say i'm sorry with porn!	really?
?	 is that joey?! let me talk to him!
uhh, my stunt double. yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.	 y'know what? i have been trying to apologize to him all week! if he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, i'm gonna go down there and do it in person.

yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.	not once did we do that.
 hi.	hey!
so i, i told rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.	oh yeah? well, howd she take it?
really well. yeah. surprisingly well. yeah, she didnt cry.	and youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?
hey! i did not cry my eyes out!! come on! its like the end of an era!	okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that? !
dude! what are yoyou trying to kill me?!	pheebs, i dont understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
hey, what is with the secrecy phoebe? huh? and what about this denise, is she cute?	pheebs, i dont understand. how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?
yeah, yeah i think im gonna find my own place.	hey-hey! i thought naked thursdays was just our thing man!
dude, some guy just called for you.	who was it?
okay listen, yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?	sure!
okay, i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! okay, whatever, i really havent thought about it that much.	well, i like that idea. obviously! i was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like space invaders and asteroids for $200, the real ones!
no.	okay so you mean no as in, gee chandler, what an interesting idea. lets discuss it before we reject it completely.
oh, im sorry. of course i mean that. interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.	so, thats it?
i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.	which is why asteroids is perfect! its the oldest game!
what do you have against the beautiful guest room?	i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
are you mocking me?	no, im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.
hey, whats up?	nothing, monica and i had a stupid fight.
but youre still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today.	 wanted. female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly. nice!
hi.	hi, listen, im sorry about before. i dont need to have a game room. i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls, and now i can emnow, i have you. not-not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, i see women
stop it chandler. im sorry too.	really?
yeah! oh yes!	ohh.
listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.	thats a great idea! we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
totally!	we dont have to come up with this now.
oh good.	hey, yknow what? why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room?
changes?	yeah, i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.
youre-youre-youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here?	is that a problem?
well, its a set and they should probably stay together.	oh, thats cool. then ill just bring them both over.
see now-now youre taking them away from their home.	okay, i get it. so, i get nothing! nothing here is mine! everything here is yours!
yeah-yeah, yknow what? yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! nothing will be yours! thats-thats what i said!	in the game room!
look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!	all right! thats fine! thats fine! i wont bring over the chairs!
whoa!! now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. i want you to really think about your answers. okay?	 you can call off the roommate search! hi! ill be living here.
oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but i dont think hes gonna get it.	why did you take the shower curtain down?
well, apparently not, and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. i mean, enough of the silliness!	well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!
 okay-okay! two very good points, look ive known you both a long time, and ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. do you really want to throw that all away over a room? that is so silly.	well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
love is the best medicine.	thats laughter.
why do you do it?	i dont know.
okay! all right! now, chandler you-you wanna live with monica, right?	yeah, i do.
thats very funny!	hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
okay, there are no stupid fights!! this isnt about the room, this is about what the roomrepresents! and unfortunately, this room  could destroy you! !	yeah, i'm not so worried.
you still want to move in together right?	of course!
ross didnt scare you?	scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
come here, i want to show you something!	okay!
this is where i thought the barca lounger could go! you see you could see the tv and its still walking distance to the kitchen.	oh thats so sweet! i want to show you something too!
okay!	yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say merge?
uh-hmm.	yknow? so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. because, thats you and i together! merge!
oh my god! i love that!	really? !
hey!	oh, whats the matter?
well, you know that psychic i see?	yeah?
well, she told me that im gonna die this week, so im kinda bummed about that.	what? !
i dontshe said yknow that id have triplets! but she also said one of them would be black.	just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go?
 hey everyone!	oh hi!
ohh! okay! okay. there are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.	why dont you open with a joke?
open with a joke? its a university, not a comedy club!	wait a minute, hold the phone! youre not talking about chuckles university? !
i-i-i dont even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it. yknow what? im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.	thats the way i did it til i was 19.
hey! any good mail?	yes, you got something from the screen actors guild.
ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, im kinda.	 benefits lapsed.
hmm thats weird. i dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.	okay, its not a check. theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
let me see that!	all right.
 oh, i cant believe this! this sucks! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? and it wouldnt matter.	im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
all right well, i guess i gotta go get a job. im gonna go see my agent.	okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
 hey! so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and ill have my health insurance back in no time.	thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?
what? !	whats wrong with you?
nothing! well, i-i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before, then i uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. but um, i dont think its anything serious.	this sounds like a hernia. you have toyou-you go to the doctor!
no way! kay look, if i have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!	thats a hernia.
dude! hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing.	i will loan you the money. just go to the hospital and lets just get that thingpushed back in.
hey!	hey.
whats going on?	oh joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix!
 thank you.	but are you sure you can do this?
yeah! and hey, thanks for coming with me. and thanks again for helping me take a shower.	now, is that never talking about it again? !
cut!!!!!!!!! !	im sorry! hey-hey joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt? take a look at this kiddo. we have a crying child!
hey-hey-hey!	what are you doing?
were just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.	oh, all right.
when?! after the birth of our first secret child?! ross didnt get the annulment; we are still married.	what?
okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. but i just couldnt face another failed marriage.	okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
another lie. you have a sickness!	ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya?
theres a lost and found? my shoe!	you left a shoe here? !
well, i didnt realize until i got home. i wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! yknow what? im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.	oh good, when he comes back for his keys, ill be sure to give him your shoe.
oh my god, what a fun day! that sounds great!	 yeah, all right.
okay, well ill bring them by tomorrow morning. okay, and uh, by the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre frank and alices triplets. okay, see ya!	whoa-whoa-whoa! what?
dont worry about it phoebe, well absolutely do it.	yeah, im gonna pass. cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
nope, sound like me. pheebs, its going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler.	little baby girl chandler, where i have heard that before? oh right, coach ruben. do you know what pheebs? when youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.
na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.	see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
what do you mean?	i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and yknow mon, you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around
that sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.	okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.
 hey guys!	hey!
hey babies! oh, im having the best morning. that uh, that porsche ive got the keys too, still there!	shocking! since you still have the keys.
you should see the treatment i get when im with that car! people are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! one guy gave me advice about my equity investments.	what equity investments?
oh yeah, i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound.	you dont even have a car!
i know. but umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so i washed it.	and?
and six others.	there you are.
yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same.	 check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, they can meet krog!
chandler, what are you doing? that thing can put someones eye out!	he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!
no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up.	theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
what? !	glass, sand, whatever.
how are you still single? !	 all right. i thought about it and maybe youre right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.
good. what made you change your mind?	i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
how did that happen?! !	well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow? and it turns out i was wrong. and now its lodged in my throat.
 so the porsche guy took his car back.	but you found the keys to his clothes?
of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! right?	that is true.
come on! what are you doing?! im in character! would you talk to her!	ahh, i think it just moved. its really poking me.
but no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.	i think thats gum.
im pretty sure its gun.	okay, listen this really hurts. lets go.
 how do you feel?	well, lets just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.
okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed.	and protected them from a tornado?
but my apartment!	was the setting of phoebes triumph.
but the mess!	is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
youre right, youre right i shouldnt freak out. cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be? !	 phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!! !
right! and when is that due?	first of the month.
and thats every month?	no, just the months you actually want to live here.
ahhh.	okay, here is the phone bill.
 oh my god! !	thats our phone number. now look, i know i kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont i justwhy dont i just cover you for a while?
no-no! no way! joey tribbiani does not take charityanymore.	its not charity, joe
no! forget it! okayi mean thanks, but im done taking money from you. all right, i can take of myself.	okay uh, heres the electric bill.
this is how much we pay for electric?!! !	uh, yeah.
so is joey going to have to give up the apartment?	no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it.
well, how much do you think he needs?	i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride.
why dont you hire him as an actor? you could have him dress up and put on little skits. whatever you want.	well that would help the pride thing.
 hey!	hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow?
 okay.	okay! so, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
hey!	hey!
hey! so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?	well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.
 okay! the movers will be here in 11 hours. rachel has not packed. now, everybody has to help!	oh nope, i-i have plans with joey.
i thought you said you were going to do nothing.	yes, but for the last time.
its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. where-where is he?	hes at a dinner party.
here it is! our last pizzas together as roommates.	oh, i wish id know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese.
oh thats okay. hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!	say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
what, are you crazy? you havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. it would be easier if you just give me your money.	yes it would. what do you say to $50?
okay, youre on.	okay, lets play! the big game, italy vs. china, apparently.
 yes! i win again! ha-ha! thats like 500 bucks you owe me!	okay, give me a chance to win my money back. okay? sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
you serious?	oh yes!
okay, get ready to owe me!	okay.
this sucks man! the last night youre here and i lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.	well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little blackjack?
nah, not my game.	okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? we could play a new game. a new game, its fun.
well, whats it called?	cups.
i dont know how to play cups.	ill teach ya! come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun.
all right.	okay, here you go. i have two queens, what do you have?
a two and a five.	ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
really? !	oh yeah! okay, lets play again. what do you got?
a four and a nine.	youre kidding right?
no. why?	well thats a full cup!
well, what did you have?	it doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. that my friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?
uh,  wow, 700.	not 700 exactly?
yeah.	double it!
what?	well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
really?	hey, i didnt make up the rules. now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getno way!
hey!	whats wrong?
ross and i were helping the girls pack, took a little break, i lost $1,500 to him in cups!	wh-how did you lose at cups? !
the same way you lost. i started out with a king and a queen, bamn! ross gets a 2 and a 3. then i get a jack and a king, boom! ross gets a 4 and a 5!	oh man! !
and he never played before either! yknow what i think? i think beginners luck, very important in cups.	all right, lets play one more hand! one more!
no, no, no more! i cannot lose another dime! im serious this time! in-in fact, look, theres ai wanna give you something.	i cant take the big white dog! you love it!
its him, not it!	no, but waitwhat if i bought it from you, yknow? and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?
wait a second, i see what youre trying to do here! you-youre trying to give me money again!	when did i try to give you money?
over there! before, with the bills! you tried to give some charity, i said no, you dropped it. okay?	im just trying to help you out! okay? i wanna make sure that youre okay.
bye.	 hey.
she really left.	i know.
thank you.	no problem roomie.
can i ask you a question?	sure!
and now you want that money back.	exactly.
chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?	its not a real game! i made it up!
im sorry you lost your money, but i won it fair and square.	at a fake game! !
now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, id be glad to play you for it. but i should warn you, i am very good at cups.	okay! now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last.
no.	hmm, lets see if it comes up this time.
so, i just finished this fascinating book. by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.	 and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.
 honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!	i didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
oh, so you can move them!	yes, and while i'm doing that, ross has a great computer story for you.
i didn't know that! well, what a pretty last name!	so, uh, wh-where ya from?
thank you for bringing her into our lives.	unbelievable
oh, so you like her too chandler?	hey, look at all the boxes!
yeah, yeah man don't do it. i mean if you date her, then-then-then i can't date her.	all right, think about it. now remember when you were going out with that girl donna and you guys broke up. remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
oh god, yeah.	now imagine you live at the supermarket.
 okay!	no-no
 i gotcha! !	 oh my god! you-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
boy, it was so hard not to laugh, i tell ya. hey, hey, the place looks great!	yeah, not bad right? you know what, monicas gonna be working late, so i'm gonna make this place spotless. you know what else i'm gonna do, know what else i'm gonna do? i'm gonna go downstairs, i'm gonna get her some flowers.
 i don't! no, i wanna live with the super-hot australian dancer.	yeah, now how's that going though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
 wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. so, mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin?	what does it look like i'm doing? i am cleaning!
did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?	authorization? i don't need that. i'm gonna put everything back.
put it back exactly where you found it?	yes i'm gonna put it back  exactly where i found it.
kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.	she's not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
whoa, hello, did you just meet monica?	she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. cause when you have to move back in with joey, joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.	i see, i see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
look chandler, monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she is going to freakout. oh my god, she's going to sit on you.	no, she's not okay? and i'll prove it to you. i'm gonna call her right now. phone's done ehh.
 hi!	hey mon, how's it going?
terrible. if-if i want something done right, i have to do it myself. other people just wreck stuff. i really think i might kill someone tonight.	oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
it's worse. the only thing that's getting me through is knowing that i'm gonna be seeing you soon. i think i may even try to get out of here early.	no! no-no-no-no-no-no. it sounds like they really need you down there.
well, are you just hanging out with ross?	it's, all good! okay bye-bye mon! she's-she's gonna kill me.
yeah that-that, doesn't look right.	what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... ok, ok, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.	ok well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
whoa, whoa, whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.	yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...rooosss!!! !
monica's gonna kill you! look i need your help, i have to do something to-to repel this woman! wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time. 	oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?
look, we do not repel women ok? that is completely untrue.	oh no, yes we do my man. remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine?
yeah, well what about you? you weren't you know, so hot in college either. after everything he said, he'd go ba dum bum chessh	yeah, monica doesn't like that either, maybe i should stop doing that.
oh y'know what, girls don't like it when i start talking about science.	that's not specific to girls.
uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.	and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.	man, i'm so lucky i have monica.
 what? !	 i couldn't say that i was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
is it the same thing that chandler had?	look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
okay, listen, there's still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. bye!	bye! thank god
dude, what'd you have?	look, we have no time okay? we must focus. we gotta get everything back into its original place.
 the photo album! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.	that's perfect! that's brilliant!
is it okay for me to come in now?	uh-huh
bye!	no, i don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.	okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you, so, i-i-i cleaned the apartment. so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it, where it went back and i'm sorry, i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.
it's okay. chandler, are you afraid of me or something?	do you want me to be afraid of you?
of course not. i mean gosh, chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it. i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place, but i'd never expect you to worry about that.	really?
of course!	oh well you're the best. you come here to me.
yeah, i gotta go.	ba dum bumb cheshhh!

but, pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where i actually work. but, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. cause kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much.	thats weird. i dont think my boss likes me either.

wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.	yes, but i feel like ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. you know. in fact i think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
you know what? this has been kind of a girlie day. youre right, im sorry.	nah, nah, its okay. i feel like i need to be in guy place. you know, do kind of like a man thing.
yeah. go over to joeys. go over to joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.	you know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
hey chandler. come on in. were knitting pot holders.	no thanks, josephine.

 so! dinner in the kitchen around four! ill see you then.	why wouldnt they be happy?
well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. im sorry.	what? what? why? !
maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.	is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me?
look, i know that i shouldve told them. i know i shouldnt care what they think. im sorry.	yknow, itll be okay. itll be okay. because when they come over, i will be all charming, i will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em.
you really think thatll work?	hey, i can be pretty charming, babe, i won you over, didnt i?
 yes, of course they like you!	well monica just told me that they dont.
 yeah, they dont like you.	 do you know why?
i dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. or maybe its cause you uh-	 well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess!
maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh?	maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment.
well maybe i love ya.	[mocks that last comment].

 i think hes stoned again.	 what?
okay, i think i might know why my parents dont like you.	you do? why?
okay, remember, we were young. hey, spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.	what?! why did you do that?
i dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, im im sorry. i-i didnt think it would matter.	how could it not matter? !
how was i supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?	what about all that friends forever stuff?
were trying to get ross stoned!	your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
ross, i cant believe youd do that!	the reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?
oh and  okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, i learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! and smiling , okay?	yeah, im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.

or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? no! didnt think so! okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are!	oh, the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage! hmm, i wonder what i could get monica thats as good as garbage?
no, dont look directly at them!	what?
oh, this ones for chandler. here.	oh great!
ooh, lets open them!	okay! okay! okay!
hee hee!	wait, we cant do this.

whatever linus, im opening mine.	nobody is opening anything ok? look, i dont know about you guys, but i wanna see the look on monicas face when i give her my present, and im sure she wants to see the look on my face when i get mine. so please, please, can we just, can we put them back?

no, thats vh-1. i gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . .	joey, why is your cable out?
i uh, oh! because, uh, i havent really paid the bill	if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?
no, chandler. look, forget about it, okay? look, i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out. oh, was she hot.	whoa ho.
i know! yeah, but, look i can handle it. all right? look, i can listen to the radio, huh?	 all right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
sure.	 paid your phone bill?
you forget how many great songs heart had.	yeah.
you know, barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.	so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
what, you didnt get it? the doctor is a monkey.	and monkeys cant write out prescriptions.
your joke? well, i think the hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
well, i was going to stick it in the atm, but now i think ill show the sexy teller that i am a published writer.	well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?	yeah!
well, im not going to go now anyway .	okay .
 she picked rachel. i mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel.	 he took my joke, he took it.
its wrong. you know what else is wrong? phoebe picking rachel.	you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else ross did? he stole my joke. you know what?
thats a good idea.	yeah!
do you know whats a bad idea?	picking rachel.
thats right. did you hear something?	maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
its kind of embarrassing, yknow. i mean, i was an actor and now im a waiter. its supposed to go in the other direction.	so is your apron. youre wearing it like a cape.
see, now its weird again.	i think its great that you work here. youre going to make a lot of money, and heres your first tip dont eat yellow snow. . ah ha ha, 215, coffeehouse.

okay, chandler, you go first.	okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.
oh, wait, is he the guy i met at christmas?	can i finish my story? !
continue.	so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and steves doctors name is doctor muppy. so i said, doctor monkey? and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up.
are you kidding? okay, look. i-i studied evolution. remember, evolution?	im not arguing with that.
its your joke.	is not.
hi, chandler. there you are.	hi, oh hi.
hey, its phoebe and rachel. um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?	 monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit.
im out of words. should i just say the whole thing again?	 youre a little high maintenance.
look, i am not high maintenance. i am not. chandler!	 youre a little high maintenance.
ahhh! you are on my list.	im sorry. youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. and when you get upset about the little things, i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that. and thats good too.
  i didnt even tell him to say that. . all right youre off my list.	 im off the list.

okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? lets do something crazy!	i know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids.

yeah?	its nice.
are you kidding me?! is this; is this turning you on?	yes!
i cant believe it! what is it? is it the rubbing or the smell?	its all very, very good. so you wanna go uh, mix it up?
not now, im sick!	oh come on you big faker!
what happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?	well that was before all the vaporizing action.
okay, if you really wanna have sex	okay!
oh yes, its me! sorry!	 what are you doing here?
uh, im just, im just looking out your window. at-at the view. what are you guys doing?	we got some vap-o-rub in some places.

oh.	ho-oh, hes gonna get some! of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister. well, im off to bed!
joey we know you steal our food.	im good.
yeah. and yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? is that perverted old couple two doors over.	 is that a swing?
oh dont even ask!	yuck!
i cant believe ross went out with rachels sister! when chandler made out with my sister i was mad at him for 10 years.	that was like 5 years ago.
yeah you got 5 years left!	joey
oh yknow whats sadder than this? bambi. i cried for three days with that movie. no wait two!	 well see now that i can see crying over, but bambi is a cartoon!
 you didnt cry when bambis mother died?	yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! i mean you dont have to be so macho all the time.	im not macho.
yeah youre right. i dont know what i was thinking.	no, i guess i just never really cried. yknow? im not a crying kind of guy.
come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?	id be sad sure, but i wouldnt cry.
okay, what if the puppy said, help me chandler. all the other puppies pick on me.	cry?! i just found a talking puppy, im rich!
all right, whats going on there?	oh, thats parents day, first grade. thats me with the janitor martin.
where were your parents?	oh they didnt want to come!
so that story doesnt make you cry?	no! look, i dont cry! its not a big deal! okay?
uhhh, yeah. yeah. but uh, i dont think its the kind youre gonna like.	you didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
what?! !	phoebe buffay in buffay the vampire layer.
this is so bizarre. i guess it kinda makes sense though, yknow she had such a terrible childhood.	hey, i had a terrible childhood and i dont do porn.
hold on a second! what is that on her ankle?	her ankle is what youre watching?
well its hard to tell  oh god, if she would just stop moving.	shes just doing her job!
hey sweetie!	hey!
 chicken soup for the soul?	theres no back to this couch!
why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff.	yeah i know, but i figured a shot yknow? maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think i was yknow, all dead inside.
oh thats so sweet! look chandler i dont care if you cant cry, i love you.	oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
stop it!	no, i mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and im like this.
i wont care, because i know you will be feeling it all in here.	yeah?
yeah! and if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! and-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me.	okay, well i wont uh, worry about this anymore then.
and-and-and if i die, from a long illness. and youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, i will always be with you, and you still cant shed one tiny tear, i know youll be crying a river inside.	aww, i love you so
what is wrong with you?!! !	what? !
what?! you cant shed a tear for your dead wife!! now, i left you a note from the beyond!	so you didnt mean any of that? !
what?! you kissed!	 maybe we should give them some privacy.
shhhh!!!	 i just dont see why those two cant work things out!
oh my god! are-are you crying?	 i just dont see why those two cant work things out!
bye.	 i-i cant believe jills gone. i cant help it, i opened a gate.
id bet id still be doing my kara-tay. towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical.	maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure.	sure i would!
 oh yeah! come on! yeah right!	what, you guys really think that im that shallow?
hey, imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives! oh-hey, theres carol again!	what if i had had the guts to quit my job? id probably be writing for the new yorker, getting paid to be funny. but my jobs fun too! i mean tomorrow, i-i dont have to wear a tie.
oh dear god, let me think.	 hey.
oh no! whats the matter?	oh i just got another rejection letter. they said my writing was funny, just not archie comic funny.

oh my god, richard.	what?! im chandler! oh, thats richard!
 monica! chandler!	hey-hey, hey! i dont know why i did that!
well, my nose got lonely.	 and uh, you dont have a mustache which is good. im chandler; i make jokes when im uncomfortable.

oh. good to see you guys.	yes.
for further reading on the above story, please check out  the one where joey moves out.}	i got a good one, i got a good one! i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
ohh.	what? !
oh my god, you guys! !	 before you say anything, have we got a story for you! guess who we bumped into at dinner!
who?	richard!
what? a-ohh! ohh. oh thats right thats right.	oh you knew that. good!
shes leaving for three months.	for camp!
ive got to talk to her. ugh, i hate this part.	hey, you have to forget about elizabeth. i mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year!
 okay.	 what did you guys just do? !
what happened?	richard was there so i couldnt do it!
what?! noooo	im gonna do it tomorrow yknow, and-and surprise her, but now youve ruined it!
we didnt ruin it!	who walks into a room and asks to see a persons hands? !
good one! yeah.	this is terrible. what am i going to do?
look, she only suspects something okay? she doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.	thats right, i can throw her off. i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
yeah! yeah! convince her that-that youre scared of commitment! convince her that youre a little coward!	i can do that, ive had 30 years of practice.
hey!	hey!
what are you up too?	oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites. yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
well thats a little crazy. although i am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the internet.	yeah, well yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
why?! to celebrate your relationship! to solidify your commitment! to declare your love for one another to the world!	eh
so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you?	sure i do. in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. i mean look at pigs. lets take a second here and look at pigs.
yeah, but thats pigs not people!	if marriage worked, id be all for it. but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
wait a minute. are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?	well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never.
oh my god! then-then-then what are we even doing?! what is this? !	whoa! whoa! whoa! what is all this pressure?!
yknow what?! i gotta go! ugh!	 its okay, i got a plan.
where the hell have you been? !	i was making a coconut phone with the professor.
richard told monica he wants to marry her!	what? !
yeah! yeah, ive been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldnt keep flying off!	myoh my god!
i know! they suck! !	hes not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! im supposed to do that!
i know!	well what yknow what im gonna do? im gonna go over there; im gonna kick his ass! will you help me? !

well im sorry.	and what does she have to think about? i love her!
well, apparently im willing to offer her things that you are not.	but i am willing to offer her all those things. this was just a plan, yknow? a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things, shed be surprised!
well if it helps, it worked very well.	it was working until you showed up, you big tree! i mean, this isnt fair. you had your chance with her! you had your chance and you blew it!

i-i did! i told her everything, chandler! but she wouldnt believe me.	well where where did she go?

paris?	we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la .
keep talking.	then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not just because its romantic, but because i can!
 bonjour, monsieur.	okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.
yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.	pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me?	what a great apology! and you accept! okay, bye-bye!
my sweet sixteen! remember, you went to third base with my cousin charlie.	 ahh, third base.
uh, rachel, ive been thinking. i dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. im calling it off.	 why to save your dignity my man.
 i cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night! !	well, somebody should.
i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together, but i must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement im going to announce that im pregnant!	how is that ever going to happen? !
look, i am soso happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that im not. im not even close. and i dont know, maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better. and i know that thats dumb, but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler!	 i dont care, she slept with me.
congratulations man.	thanks.
 im sorry i almost made you sleep with ross.	thanks.
oh thank you.	okay.
 oww!	whats the matter honey?
okay!	 already? !
yeah, we got a lot to do! we gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music	oh, i got some thoughts on that.
 okay!	what in gods name is that? !
a jazz trio for cocktails. the bay city rollers for dancing. wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.	well, you couldnt get them anyway. ian doesnt plan anymore and derrick  and derrick is a name i shouldnt know.
 hey mon, do you have another pillow? yknow, something a little snugglyer?	why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!	now, do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
of course you can look at it! yeah, i want your opinion too!	okay.
here you go! what do you think about centerpieces?	centerpieces!
yeah! roses or lilies?	definitely roses. well, i just think theyre a little more weddingy. but lilies are the clear choice.
oh my god! its like one mind.	uh-huh!
so chandler, youre parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.	oh yeah, i should probably call them.
i remember when we first got engaged.	oh, i dont think i ever heard that story.
 you dont know how that happened?! your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!	what a sweet story.
well it was chandler! we didnt think hed ever propose!	clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
i cant believe this. do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	i dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. shes saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  dollywood.
wait, but theres no money! well this is terrible! you guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!	honey, its gonna be okay.
no, yknow what? its gonna be okay. i mean you dont have to have this rustic italian feast. yknow?	look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married.
how? i dont have any money.	well, i have some.
how much?	well, close to
how great are you, you little saver?! i mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!	well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
 ohh, you guys are so made for each other.	well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
ah, yeah!	well, come on, ive been saving this money for six years and i kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
this is the most special day of our lives.	no, i realize that honey, but im not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
honey, umm i-i love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. okay? listen, we could always earn more money, okay? but uh, were only gonna get married once.	look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answer is no.
you-youre gonna have to put your foot down?	yes, i am!
hey.	hey.
listen umm, ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. i mean, you work, you work really hard for that.	ehh.
eh, you work for that.	look, i thought about it too, and im sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
you do? !	yeah, im putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do.
oh, youre so sweet. oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?	eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, yknow? well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
you thought about that?	yeah.
how many kids were we gonna have?	uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
what else did you think about?	well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.
 yknow what? i-i dont want a big, fancy wedding.	sure you do.
no, i want everything you just said. i want a marriage.	you sure?
uh-hmm.	i love you so much.
i love you. hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.	oh yeah, totally!
hey!	so, what do you think?
what?	are you kidding? okay, ill give you a hint; ill give you a hint.
eyes! no, no. your eyes! no.	i got glasses!
well, you-youve always had glasses.	no i didnt!
yes!	no!
sweetie, i think the glasses look great. they make you look really sexy.	really?
yeah!	 you didnt think i used to wear glasses, right?
so what do you guys want for an engagement present?	thats okay pheebs, were not having a party or anything, so you dont have to get us
hey, i know i what i want!	what we want honey.
you mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that i would never let out of our family?	dying people say the craziest things.
okay. im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies.	our kids are gonna be fat arent they.
 ahoy!	hey! hows the boat? !
oh, its great! its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.	well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.
what?	nothing, i just like to go like this.
 hey chandler, what are you doing tonight?	uh why, do you have a lecture?
no, why?	then free as a bird. whats up?
yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for chancy, i assumed he meant you.	well, did-did you correct him?
he hates to lose.	oh no problem, maybe ill play with my left hand.
youre not a lefty?	does anybody know me? !
oh, we have to get you an engagement present?	dont worry about it pheebs.
okay, here i wish you health and happiness.	an old cookie?
this is what happens when you dont register for gifts!	we cant accept this.
see no-no, i made a batch and i froze it, and this is the only one left.	we cant accept this.
why not?	cause its gross.
yeah! i bet i can do it.	okay, we owe you a present.
well i had a great time! umm, chancy on the other hand	i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. we were bonding.
oh my god chandler! i cant believe it!	i know.
you gave my father a lap dance!	why do they put so much steam in there? !
cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.	why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
come on, its not that big a deal!	not that big a deal? therethere was touching of things.
listen, im sure that dad doesnt care. he probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years!	i dont want him to tell this story for years.
you were trying to eat it!	if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
 yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.	look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap. and by face, i dont mean my ass.
i understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy i was unemployed, and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer.	what did you do when they found out?
they never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. shall we?	so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!
 hello? hold on please. joey, its your mom.	its your mommy. its your mommy.
it wasnt the best.	that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv.
i dont know. i dont know. i cant lie to him again. oh no ino!	and say nothing?
hey sweetie.	hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?
 anyway, i should go. okay, bye.	hi sweetie. so, what was with all the whispering?
i cant tell you. its a secret.	secret? married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. we have too much love and respect for one another.
awww. but still no.	no im serious, we should tell each other everything. i do not have any secrets from you.
really? okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to ross junior year at disneyland?	oh no-no, i cant do that.
if you tell me, ill tell you what phoebe said.	okay.
okay.	so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, were on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.
oh my god. he threw up?	no, he visited a little town south of throw up. so what was phoebes secret?
oh, nancy thompson from phoebes old massage place is getting fired.	thats it?! i gave up my disneyland story for that?
chandler, you have an assistant right?	 did she call? you-you told her i was sick right? always tell her i am sick!
no, i-i just dont know how you decide who to hire. i mean ive got it narrowed down to two people. one of them has great references and a lot of experience and then theres this guy	what about him?

you kissed a guy?!! oh my god.	in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
and this girl is making eyes at chandler, okay? so after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing. now, i know what youre thinking, chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.	in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
oh mon, i laughed so hard	ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
all right! all right! chandler entered a vanilla ice look-a-like contest and won!	ross came in forth and cried!
its hard for some people!	 of course it is. wowwhoa!
chandler one time wore my underwear to work!	hey!! !
ohh! ohh! in college, chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!	that was you!
and in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!	 you have no trouble telling time now right?
no!	quick! what time is it? !
i dont know! time to kiss a guy maybe?! what are you laughing at pampers?	yknow when i said that because were getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?

hey, divorced men are not bad men!	they have that on the napkins at the club.
yeah but, my assistant tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. ohh! i could just spread him on a cracker.	rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? i mean yknow you cant date him right?

sorry!	you didnt bring me here to do that, did you?
well, she saw the ring.	did she freak out?
well, she was shocked when i told her, but then again so were most people.	right.

come on! so she comes to the wedding! i mean it wont be so bad.	what do you think shes just gonna sit there quietly? you dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? you dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing part-time lover? !
oh my god, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either is she? !	yknow what? its gonna be okay. yknow what? shes probably not gonna even want to come.
really?	no! that was a lie! see how easy that was?
so-so you wouldve just lied?	yes! !
would it really have been that easy?	yes!! !
i should just go on to happier things, okay? umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?	well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. um, its going to be a small ceremony. uh, tiny! were not even sure why were having it.
what are we gonna do?	i say we go with careless whisper.
chandler?	 did she see us yet? did she see us?
our kids are gonna call her aunt janice arent they?	arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
please, its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do.	arent you just a tinsy bit curious?
well justwell just let her stay.	no-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
kinda like your barca lounger.	is that what youre thinking about right now?
hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath.	janice, im sorry but umm, you cant stay here tonight.
why not?	honestly? our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. now monica and i have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
he does?	say again?
thats right. thats right. and that is why you cant stay here tonight. and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding.	feelings, such strong feelings.
 dont sweat it, ive got this section covered. yeah, in fact ive got this little baby  to shine in peoples eyeokay, see you later.	i just wanted to show monica your book.
 hey everybody! happy thanksgiving!	no, no, no. no-no-no.
what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year?	no, we're playing this game i learned at work. you have to name all the states in six minutes.
what? that's like insanely easy!	now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
all right, i got 48.	oh that's not bad, pheebs?
oh, i got tired of naming states. so i decided to list the types of celery, and i have one regular celery.	okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead invegetables, joey?
hey! how is new england not a state? huh? they have a sports-team!	does south oregon have a sports-team? there you go.
done! with time a-to-spare.	oooh that may be a new world's record
you know, i hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and joey can't name all the states. did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called a globe? hmm?	uh, magellan? you got 46 states.
all right, i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna turn on joey's. please, watch him! do not let joey eat any of the food!	i am only one man! okay ross, time is up!
no, just give me another minute.	look ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself.
this-this is crazy! i can do this! all right, uhh, i bet i can get all 50 before dinner.	okay, but if you can'tno dinner!
chandler? can you give me a hand?	sure, and joey; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
rosss apartment is nice! how come we don't hang out here more often?	i don't know. maybe it's because it smells a little weird. it's like old pumpkins or something.
that's my pie!	which smells delicious!
uh-oh! uh-oh!	what?
phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!	tell her, i'm allergic, and i will sue!
no that's just me coughing! oh, good, there you are! listen, um, i have a dog in my room.	what is it doing here?
oooh, i wish she could stay here, but chandler is allergic!	extremely allergic, okay? if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!
that's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days	 really?
chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?	well, it still has to go, right?
why?	okay, it's um
don't do what?	 i have to! okay? it's time! okay, i hate dogs.
told ya.	they are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.
wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies?	 is there a puppy here?
you don't like puppies?	 okay, you are new!
it's too cold.	okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
 it hurts my teeth.	and i don't wanna say this, i don't you guys to hate me, but uh, i don't think, i can be around that dog anymore. okay, so either the dog goes, or i go. oh my god! !
where's chandler?	 here i am.
wash your hands!! !	how did youknow?
see, this is exactly what we do not have time for.	 where's monica?
um, in phoebe's room. you can't go in there.	why not?
monica's crying. she's very upset about this whole clunkers thing.	well, i, i should go in there.
no. no, no. she doesn't want to see you right now.	why not?
because you sent away the dog!	this is ridiculous.
 okay, i'm in my sweat pants. bring on the food! what's the matter?	monica's all upset, because i sent clunkers away.
so? bring the dog back, you're a hero.	yeah, i can be a hero, i could do that. i could, i could do... i, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
chandler, it's like a big gerbil.	and that doesn't scare you?

hey!	if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees...	 ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!
 and hugs him)	hey!
what are you doing here, santa?	well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weirdturtle-man?
i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend. you sent me here to give ben some presents. remember?	what?
did you bring me any presents, santa?	you bet i did, ben, put it there! well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! ho, ho, ho!
what are you doing?	you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!
thank you, but, but you gotta leave.	why?
because, i'm finally getting him excited about hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it.	but i didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
i'm sorry, chandler but this, this is really important to me.	fine, i'll give the suit back.
hey, you think, you can keep it another night? 	santa? really?
yes, is that okay?	did your dad ever dress up like santa?
no.	then it's okay!
no! why does he have to go?	because, if santa and the holidayarmadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. merry christmas!
fine, i-i give up. santa, santa can stay.	well, i'll stay, but only because i wanna hear about hanukkah. ben, will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah?
yeah?	my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt.
 hi.	hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
oh, yknow i'm not that much of a sweet tooth. iwow. my god, so creamy. oh my god, this is the best cheesecake i have ever had.	 it was at the front door. when i got home. somebody sent it to us.
chandler, this is not addressed to you. this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs. thief.	ino! i didn't read the box before i opened it. and you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
why, why not?	because it's too delicious.
chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.	no-no-no! it is going to be okay, because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  mommas little bakery. i feel terrible, im a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
all right, i should get going, big day a work. yknow im in a coma? today, they do this test on me and it turns out im not brain dead.	so
okay.	oh, whats at 800?
my god, i cant believe this! i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited, but i thought that was it! i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable!	well, maybe since the age of 9, frannies made some new friends.
yknow, she tried to undress me too.	i used to undress my cousin glenn.
hi!	another cheesecake came! they delivered it to the wrong address again!
so just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?	i cant seem to say goodbye.
are you serious?! chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?	well ive forgotten what it tastes like okay? !
it was cheesecake. it was fine. it had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  wow! my whole mouth just filled with saliva!	 yknow what? forget it! we are just hungry! we have not had lunch!
yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.	good idea. where do you want to go to lunch?
what? wait a minute, i didnt pay, i thought you paid!	so apparently we just dont pay for food anymore. do you see what i see?
 its still there!	mrs. braverman must be out.
she could be out of town. maybe shell be gone for months.	by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
no that could kill her.	well, we dont want that.
no so were protecting her.	but we should take it.
but we should move quick.	why?
because i think i just heard her moving around in there.	go! go! go! go!
 oh my god! that is so good!	im full, and yet i know if i stop eating this, ill regret it.
oh its umm, its tofu cake. do you want some?	what are you doing tonight?
huh? uh	dude! dude!
oh! sorry. uh, ive got those plans with phoebe, why?	oh really? uh, monica said she had a date at 900.
what?! tonight? !	thats what monica said.
 mm-mmm.	i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. how can you eat the cheesecake without me? !
oh, what are you going to do?! are you gonna go run tell monica?! are you gonna tell joey?! no!	yknow what? i dont trust you with this cake anymore! and i got it first, and im takin it back!
what?! what? !	oh yes!
wait a minute!	oh yes!
you think i trust you with it?! no! were gonna split it! you take half and i take half!	well thats not fair, youve already had some!
what? oh, well then yknow what? i think monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.	what do we use to split it?
okay! all right, pick a half.	 okay well, this side looks bigger. uh theres more crust on this side. yknow? so, maybe if i measured
oh for god sake just pick a piece!	all right, ill pick that one.
thats also the smaller piece. okay, there you go. enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. no sharing.	 ohhh!
okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.	oh-ho-ho-ho-no! no! no switching! no sharing, and dont come crying to me!
oh! yay! look! theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!	stick to your side!
 there it is! oh, look at that! isnt mother nature amazing?	 thats a plane!
okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. can we go now? i mean, chandlers getting chilly.	 no, im not!
then why are you wearing monicas jacket?	because its flattering! come on monica! come on monica!
shes sleeping.	i know, just quick-quick question, quick question. which one was deep impact and which one was armageddon?
deep impact was the one with robert duval, armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up.	sorry, i justcant sleep. ooh! where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? because every time i look at that cover im like

with a wok? i thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.	it got interesting! damn you oprah!
here, let me make the milk, im up anyway.	hey, yknow what we can do? yknow, now that we are up? we can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were first going out. itd be fun!
okay that does sound like fun.	okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
the second sister dies? !	 no. no, i-i was, i was talking about the book i was reading.

you do know that was me who just said that right? hey. as long as were both up	 yeah? i hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room.
what?! what are you doing? !	do you know what just happened?
yeah. we-we had sex and then we fell asleep.	no. we were in the middle of sexand you fell asleep.
nooo! no, thats not true. no, best time ever! yeah, you rocked me world!	 monica?
what? !	i was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. so please wake up so we can do it right!
okay. okay, im ready. come on big fella!	okay.
give me the good stuff.	yeah! no! no! no!
that really was some of your best work.	hm-hmm, i told you! i cant believe that ive only got two hours before i call in sick for work.
i have to be up in seven minutes.	well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
really? !	do you wanna?
hey, yknow whats weird? after you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, this is my brother-in-law ross. not, my friend ross, brother-in-law ross. thats weird isnt it?	couldnt i just say, this is ross?
 uh, hello dad! monica and i just saw the house in the paper! yes were surprised! who did you leave a message with?	 sorry!
hey chandler!	hey!
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?	yeah, id love to but ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore.
well what if i told you, you can do it in my apartment?	 are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year?
i just purchased the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000.	thats awesome! thats great! what made you do it? !
well, its a long story, but umm i broke joeys chair	whoa-whoa-whoa! you broke joeys chair?
yeah.	i thought i broke joeys chair! thats why i replaced it with mine!
ohhhhh. thats how it got fixed!	well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
noo! angels.	im gettin my chair back!
well, it looks like it wasnt heeled after all! yeah! so, i guess this chair is mine now!	joey you broke my chair! !
uh-huh! nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! all right? that is my chair now!	i think i should get the chair!
how do you figure?	because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! the only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me!
no-no-no! this chairs not going anywhere.	well, wheres the logic in that? !
the logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!	so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing!
thats right!	what are you guys? like a gang or something? !
 hey.	 shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
late thirties? oh come on you guys! is it just me? am i overreacting to this?	no rach, its not just you. my thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun.

but it hurts my joeys apple.	 okay, for the last time. its not named for each individual man.
youve done a wonderful job with this party chandler. everything looks so lovely.	oh well, not as lovely as you. i mean, i cant believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! and you! i cant believe that you would have a tux thats thirty years old!
its older than that. ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.	ohh!

it sounds like its coming from across the street.	 oh my god!
what?	yknow that thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?! he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, youre half scottish right?
nooo! !	yes! !
no, there is no way! it can not be ross! unbelievable! why is your family scottish?	why is your family ross? !
he cannot play at our wedding! i mean everyone will leave! i mean come on, that is just noise! its not even a song!	if you listen very carefully, i think its celebration by cool and the gang.
do you want some shortbread? eh thats scottish like you are.	oh no thanks. i dont like any thing from my scottish heritage.
what? !	well its just my entire family was run out of scotland byvikings. anyway, lots of bad memories.
how did you know about that? !	we heard you play all the way from your apartment!
were you the ones called the cops? !	thats not really important right now. what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
why not?	because we hate them.
come on thats not fair! i mean you havent even heard me play!	we have heard you play.
what about the second minister we meet with? i kinda liked him.	you mean the spitter?
come on! it wasnt that bad!	easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil.
all right, what about the third guy?	you mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
can you blame him?	sorry, i just dont like the idea of when i say, i do, hes thinking, yeah, id do her too!
well then we still have a problem.	yeah!
what?! no! it was my idea!	guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
does calling it not mean anything anymore? !	we are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! and when i say legitimate i mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
so, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?	no, but horny for monica minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
well then let me do it!	joe
yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. itll be me! and i swear ill do a really good job. plus, yknow i love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.	 yknow, we havent found anybody else.
so i can do it?	yeah you can do it.
all right!!! okay!! all right! okay-okay, i gotta get started on my speech!	yeah.
 hey!	hey!
say hello to reverend joey tribbiani!	hey!
yeah, i just got off the internet! man, there is a lot of porn out there!	our minister
anyway, i started working on what im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?	okay.
now-now, listen this is just a first draft so  we are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that monica and chandler share. eh? it is a love based on giving and receiving. as well as having and sharing.	 should we call the spitter?
okay you guys, i got a little more written. are you ready?	yeah. o-okay.
yes!	see joe, not that thats not grrreat! but, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! yknow, it can be more personal. you can tell stories about us!
ooh, like the time you and i went to atlantic city and i made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! remember?	no, not us  us!
oh! suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!	see joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic stories. nice stories.
by doin it.	joe?
okay. all right. umm, so uh, so how did it happen? did your eyes meet across the room?	isnt that what happened with you and the brides maid?

wouldnt you be?	well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and youve had a lot to drink. and youve just got to let that go okay? i mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!
really?	you kidding? youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms   whoa! whoa! whoa!
well, not anymore.	but we dont do that.
i know, i just thought it would be fun.	how drunk are you?
drunk enough to know that i want to do this. not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.	 thats the perfect amount!
 yknow whats weird?	what?
this doesnt feel weird!	i know.
youre a really good kisser.	well, i have kissed over four women. do you wanna get under the covers?
hm-hmm!	okay!

yeah, i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. and now im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced.	but i love swing music!
yeah but the swing kings? yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsthey just stop living.	look all i know is when monica and i went to see them, we had fun! and theres another reason too.
well, what is the other reason?	i dont want to say.
well you have to because maybe its stupid.	well its just while monica and i were dancing to them it wasthe first time i knew thatyou were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with.
 dont come in here!	why? do you another boyfriend in there or something?
no! we only mess around at his place!	yknow its funny i started it but, now its scary me. so could you come out here please?
no, im wearing a wedding dress.	oh you got a wedding dress? thats great!
yeah but im not keeping it.	well then why cant i see it?
oh. i guess you can. okay but; i-i have to return it, so you cant like it.	okay i promise. ill-ill hate it. wow! you-you lookhideous.
really?	yeah, thats like the most ugliest dress ive ever seen. wh-why do you to return it?
oh because it doesntreally fit. oh by the way, i-i booked the swing kings.	oh thats great! great! thanks! but that dress i mean its like yuck!
okay! but you cant rip it. well, maybe a little.	okay!
 hey guys! do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? guys?	 i thought you were gonna be gone all day.
see? thats what i mean. i mean that, thats great! but i wouldnt trade in what i have for that.	oh totally! pull my finger.
honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?	okay. well, i think the centerpieces are too big
youre wrong! the centerpieces are fine! do you ever get scared at all?	kinda. theyre really big.
doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again?	what?
just, i love you so much. justits just sometimes it bothers me that im never gonna have that feeling. yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? yknow that rush?	no. no, see when i first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else?	sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and im afraid even more sweating.
even with me?	i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
really?	well yeah! but now that i know that youre having these thoughts, im back to panic, anxiety, and uh im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
come here! come here! sweetie you dont have to worry. no, besides yknow what?	 water! water! water!
hey!	yknow im-im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
oh boy me too!	yknow i was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
yeah?	technically we could have sex again. what do you think, bossy and domineering? !
the wedding is off, sloppy and immature!	thats me! come on!
okay. but wait, we cant. my cousin cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.	well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler.	 hi! nice to meet you!
 chandler!	ill be right with you.
what?! chandler shes our cousin!	i was not staring at her. okay? i was just listening intently. its called being a good conversationalist.
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn.	umm, so this aunt marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.	this is so sad. i mean, i only have like ten pins.
oh wow. why dont we just take me  and put me with a manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. these pins arent for playing are they?	this is so sad. i mean, i only have like ten pins.
well-wellsee? parents are comin!	yknow i think we should invite them.
oh please, you just want more blue pins.	well this is just sad!
 so now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. anything at all. but these are the three that monica pre-approved.	well, thanks a lot for hookin me up rach. i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
im monicas maid of honor. okay? dont try to blue pin me!	 well, whats the deal with these? these-these look nice.
oh they are nice. we-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when theyre done with them they just send em back.	you mean like for award shows?
some of them.	you mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, you are you wearing?! you look fabulous!
honey, might i suggest watching a little more espn and a little less e! ?	okay, who wore those?
umm, well lets see uh, this one is tom brokaw.	not bad.
 this one is uh paul oneil.	whos that?
he plays for the yankees. seriously, espn! just once and a while, have it on in the background. ooh, this one was pierce brosnan!	pierce brosnan?
uh-huh.	are you serious?
yeah.	007?! this is james bonds tux? !
yeah.	oh, i have to get married in james bonds tux!
its a pretty cool tux.	oh, its not just that, i would be englands most powerful weapon. jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. a man who fears no one; with a license to kill. would monica let me wear this?
hey! guess what i got for your wedding!	a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
no. rachel hooked me up with a tux! but not just any tux, batmans tux!	what?
thats right! made expressly for val kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat batman film he was in.	you cant wear that! im wearing the famous tux! james bonds tux!
so?	soif you wear that youll make mine less special.
well, you need something to make this day special? hello! you-you-you have the most special thing of all! you are marrying the woman you love.	please, dont take away my cool thing. please?! pretty please? !
pretty please? not very uh, 007.	look, its my wedding day okay? if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you.
when i got married you slept with my sister.	that was pretty 007.
well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.	rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman. okay batman is so much cooler than james bond!
what are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!	batman has a utility belt!
007 has a fancy car!	batman has the batmobile!
007 gets all the ladies.	batman has robin! we get espn right?
how about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and ill make you a nice martini.	actually, i dont like martinis.
how about a youhoo with a funny straw?	ooh, yum!
hey-hey! why dont we put them on? yknow get a picture of batman and james bond together.	i would but mine doesnt fit. the pants are a little tight.
between you and	i would but mine doesnt fit. the pants are a little tight.
well that stinks. i was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.	well, does that mean that youre not going to wearing yours?
what are you kidding? its batmans tux! !	 let me try it on!
okay, but just the jacket. double-oh and seven are not gettin in there.	 okay. holy double-vented comfort batman! whats this?
what?	an invitation for the at first sight premiere? oh my god! val kilmer didnt wear this in batman! he wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
let me see that! oh man!	the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
 oh.	well, youre welcome. and tell them were really glad theyre coming.
well yknow what they say, the 23rd times the charm. aww, look at you all handsome!	whose is it?
oh does it matter?! all that matters is that you look so handsome.	whose is it?
i dont want to say.	oh, come on! i dont care! come on! whose is it?
do you realize that four weeks from today were getting married? four weeks baby!! four weeks!! !	do you realize you get louder each week?
theres still so much to do. have you written your vows yet?	i figured id buy those. pat, id like to buy a vow.
sweetie, you know i have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.	right. so uh, have you written yours yet?
no! but i know exactly what im going to say.	do you happen to know what im going to say?
 lets just do it right now. okay? it wont be hard. just say whats in your heart.	  look at her go! she must love me more than i love her! whats wrong with me? ooh, dont open that door.
well with carol, i promised never to love another woman until the day i die. she made no such promise.	im so pathetic! monica knows what she wants to say! you shouldve seen her. writing, writing, writing!
well, why dont you just start with something simple. like umm, monica from the moment i met you, i knew i loved you.	yeah, im not sure i can do that.
hi, i'm ross's little sister.	 okay.
now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. you got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!	 there are seven?! thats one?
its kind of an important one!	oh, yknow-yknow what, i was looking at it upside down.
oh, i got it! how about saying something like, monica	 monica
when i look back over our time together	 yeah?
no fair. i don't even have one. how come they get two?	you'll get one.
oh yeah? when?	all right. i'll tell you what. when we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and i get together and have one?
why won't i be married when i'm 40?	oh, no, no. i just meant hypothetically.
ok, hypothetically, why won't i be married when i'm 40?	no, no, no.
what is it? is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?	 uh, uh.
well?	dear god! this parachute is a knapsack!
wait, wait, wait!	look, monica
look!	this is not going to work.
i bet this will work!	you are so great! i love you!

yes, you did!	no i didn't!
you love me!	no i don't! stop it! stop it! stop it!
then all your stuff would be here.	well, what if all my stuff was here?

you wanted it to be a surprise.	oh my god.

okay, well, we have to get past this! why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?	i can do that.
okay.	okay. now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.
oh, thank god!	oh, i know!

rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? its here.	oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it dont watch it.

oh, that's cool. we have interns at 'days of our lives'.	right. so, it'll be the same except less sex with you.
so, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?	well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.

can i get you a cup of coffee, sir?	oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that i can rent a car.
seriously, you're an intern?	yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.
 dude!	right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope

 what's wrong?	i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them.
so you're a little older. try to look at the positive you have all this life experience.	yes, but i don't think life experience with these.
what are they?	they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
 i give you $ 500 for them!	what am i supposed to do with these?
ah, come on, sneakers are easy. you wear sneakers all the time.	well, first of all, they're not called sneakers anymore. apparently, they're called kicks or skids and i think i heard somebody say slorps. and here, look they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!
okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?	no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
hey!	hey!
what are you doing?	putting on the sneakers thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything
oh, anything yet?	yes, how's this they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
we gotta get more of that.	 you know what these aren't half-bad! you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren.
okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph.	alright  i feel youger already!
 that's interesting! just one thought you didn't mention the shoes. who's next? chander	okay  you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. he's about my age
 your age?	a-huh. so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. he jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads not suitable for adults!
chandler, that's great!	oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me
you see? that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic, it's. you did you come up with that?	 i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
see all of you tomorrow.	the cold weather hurts my hip!
oh, the way you crushed mike at ping pong was such  a turn-on.you wanna...?	you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired.
i'll put a pillowcase over my head.	you're on!
sounds like he's with someone.	he could be alone. this morning i heard him do  push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
oh my god, that's charlie!	she's cheating on joey with ross!
ooh...	wow!
i can't believe this. rachel and joey?	how about the dinosaur twins in the other room? no-one is manning that wall!
i'm on it!	anything?
bedsprings, unmistakable!	you do realise  that's your brother?
wait a minute... ross and charlie, joey  and rachel, phoebe and mike! we're the only people  leaving with the  same person we came with.	that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving  with weird al.
okay, i've had it with the hair jokes. tomorrow morning,  before we leave, i'm going to the salon.	okay buckwheat!
that's the door. he's gone...	and she's... turning on the tv... and watching...  miss congeniality!
 yeah, we had a great time, thank  you!	 bye!
okay, uhm... hey, you guys seen joey anywhere?	he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend  charlie. that's the situation as we know it...
well, if you see him could you please tell  him i'm looking for him?	you got it!
all right, look you guys... look, we appreciate all  the advice, but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it...	okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you  do one thing for us? the people that  care about you?
sure...	enunciate!
hey!	hey!
you guys ready to go?	not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm  just finishing packing.
dude! you're not taking your bible?	you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's  a new testament, what are you gonna do with it?
who's day just got better? chandler!	hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
what do you think?	i think.... i think i can see your scalp.
and listen to this...	what d'ya know... it's a treat for the eyes and the  ears.
whoo, whoo. wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that i'm sitting  next to charlie after we broke up.	yeah, it's almost if air barbados doesn't care  about your social life.
no, i'll do it.	wish i could switch with someone. i really don't  wanna sit with allen iverson over there.
oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these...   ow!	you go back to work tomorrow night, right?
yeah!	so if you want people to see them, then by definition  you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be  able to do this. you like that, right?	what are you singing?
it's bolero from 10.	it's ride of the valkyries from apocalypse  now...  see, here's the thing the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy  hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore,  so if you think about it... i hate them!
you what? you said you liked them.	did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was  that i could see your scalp.
fine, so you don't like them. everybody else does.	again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey...  well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
you know what? i don't care. i like it like this,  and i'm gonna keep it. you're just jealous because your hair can't do this...   ouch!	hit yourself in the tooth?
i have a problem.	really? what happened?
well, i was dancing around, and singing no woman,  no cry and i got stuck.	you can't move at all?
oh, well, i can move...	if i untangle you, will you please get rid of thecorn rose?
 i guess so...	 some of these look a little  frayed.
look what i found in the drawer...  and you said i'd never wear this...	now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a  little something for me?
sure, what do you have in mind?	i think you know.
really? i don't really feel like it.	this is what i want to do.
okay, i just don't get why you like it so much.	 she's an  fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. there's  inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. there are so many ways  to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.	there's a hair in my coffee.
hey, have you seen frank jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with  the triplets.	you know, it's funny. every time you say triplets, i  immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
we went through the same thing when we were adopting.	so, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this  room, huh?
i think i just had a tiny orgasm.	that's great. can i see the book?
i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.	that's great. can i see the book?
can i adopt you?	hey, you must be owen.
yeah.	i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too.
you were?	yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
huh?	you know how to use a compass?
i have a badge in it.	you do? that's fantastic!
you wanna see it?	i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your  parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you.
what?! ?	what?
i'm adopted?	i got nothing.
bill and colleen's apartment. chandler comes running into the  living room. monica is the only one there.]	where are bill and colleen?
they're in the kitchen getting something to eat. can you  believe how nice they are?	we have to leave! !
why? what did you do in the bathroom?	i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way,  and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may  have told him.
i'll go get him in a second. by the way, you should know we  haven't told him he's adopted yet.	but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he  already knows?
i'm adopted? !	see? intuitive!
he told me! and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.	which technically now you should give back!
you told him he's adopted?	i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or  something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the  door. owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa  is real.
he isn't? !	we have to get out of here, baby!
uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. bill and colleen hate  us.	owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him.
still, he had to find out sometime.	yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets  that you gave birth to them?
brian buckner  produced by robert carlock and wendy knoller  transcribed by coffee mug, eleonora, sebastiano  vanessa[scene joey and rachel's apartment]	so, you and rachel tonight, huh?
yeah. it's actually our first official date	wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous?
naa, no. this is the part i'm actually good at.	what must it be like not to be crippled by fear  and self-loathing.
 it's ok!	how can you be so confident?
well, i... i know exactly what i'm gonna do!	really? like you have a routine?
no, no no no no. see. each woman is different.you have  to appreciate their uniqueness.	really?
no, i do six things! first, i look deep in her eyes. then, i kiss her. next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh.	you mean like this?
no! not like that, no no. no, like this.	oh, i see what you mean, that's quite nice.
more foosball?	...and beer! !
hey sweetie! 	hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop  staring at your sister's legs!
 wow!	hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop  staring at your sister's legs!
i'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?	she went on one of those spray-on tan places.
 why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?	 why...why?
still, i can't believe that's sprayed on... i mean,  it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one!	sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can  really show it off.
hey!	hey pheebs!
i know, amanda! ah! she called me  too! she's the worst!	who's amanda?
she's this girl who used to live  in the building before you did. then she moved to england and she picked up  this fake british accent. on the machine this is her message. monica, darling!	are you trying to do a british accent?
  chandler gets  pedicures!	just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?
have you ever done that?	no, had it done to me though. feels good !
cut her out of our lives! just ignore her calls and  dodge her 'till she gets the point!	no, had it done to me though. feels good !
ok, don't hold thy breath!	hello? is someone on the line?
yes, i was looking for monica.	hang on, she's right here. someone's on the phone, for ya.
we weren't picking up, it's  amanda!	 i get pedicures!
i went to that tanning place your wife suggested.	was that place... the sun?
  and monica and pulls up his shirt. there's a distinct line across his body,  where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)	oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory  all by yourself!
oh oh! what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?	how was your date with joey?
well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and  i kept slapping it away!	you didn't like that?
 chandler,  stop! it is not going to pop open!	 you don't  know! [scene central perk.]
 soldier down! [monica and chandlers apartment.]	if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!
ooh, that accident must have been terrible. you look  positively ghastly.	well, aren't you a treat.
i don't know.	that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she  sure can dance... hey!
hi! hey, listen, can we ask you a question? when  you and monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more  than that?	kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide  from you guys...
yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it  was... really wrong?	actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt  like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
go away! i don't want to see anybody.	i know, i went to the tanning place and the same  thing happened to me. you have to let me in.
dude, you're not tanned.	no, i just had to get a picture of this.
hey!	honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend.
no,   that day... that won't be her real birthday!	gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday   was!
well, i'm sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away. you know, to reconnect... emotionally.	there's this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim...
all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after the party.	fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this   party...
hey!	hey hey! where's the birthday girl?
oh, she's still napping	oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party   she knows is happening.
i can't believe emma is still asleep!	i know, what are we gonna do?
i've got a plan. i've got a plan. i'm going to ram this platter really   hard into your ribs. you're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!	i'm not going to vermont with this monica!
thank you so much for that gift!	i was not ready for this today!
 yes, yes. i still want   my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. yellow cake, chocolate frosting with   nuts!	to be fair this one does have nuts.
well, you know what? while we're waiting, you guys could tape your message   to emma for her 18th birthday, huh? ok!	hi emma! it's the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap?
we're aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way. you may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!	we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together   and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday.
 hello? oh no! what happened? ok ok, where are you?	was that emma? is she up?
no, wait ! you guys, no, no, you can't leave! rachel already feels bad   that the cake's messed up. how do you think she's gonna feel when she comes   back here and all you guys are gone?	i don't know! you'll tell us on monday!
where do you think you're going? 	to the bathroom!
joey! you're in charge, ok? you make sure nobody leaves!	to the bathroom!
oh no! he's not getting away that easy!	 what are you doing? get the hell out of here!
 oh! well that's it! he's the last one to go. i'm locking you   guys in.	you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?
or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..	i'm begging you stop.
 yeah!! let's do that!	 that sounds more fun than the thing we were going   to do in vermont!
ok! i want the dolphin!	thats a bear.
ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!	ok, on your mark... get set... go!! !
wha... how the hell is that gonna help?	i bought you. how did i forget that that's all you do?
the rules clearly   stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. well, our dog   never crossed the finish line, so technically...	they left.
yeah, see you later!	they left.
game?	emma, you even know it's your birthday today? you're one! one-year-old,   that's little.
that's how old you are.	did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom?
 ooh, i want one...	me too...
...and head to canada!	i was kidding.
hey, are ross and rachel back?	no, not yet.
i don't care that you left. i'm just glad that you're here. thanks   you guys!	hey, guys! come on! you gotta see what emma just did.
what?	emma, how old are you? how old are you today?
okay, here we go! emma's first birthday cake... well hey... well, blow   out the candle. come on emma.	let's do it, come on!
of course, i'd be honored!	thanks!
u-u-um, i think there's been an oversight.	joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
thank you! alright, let me see how i'm gonna start... dear baby   adoption decider people...	so excited about your letter!
yeah!	so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
you guys do that? chandler won't even have sex in	that's where people make number two! !
hey, finished my recommendation. here. and i think you'll be very, very happy. it's the   longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.	 i don't... uh... understand.
of course it does! it's smart! i used the the-saurus!	on every word?
oh, they are warm, nice, people with big hearts'.	and that became they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens   with full sized aortic pumps...?
well, because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani . hey, why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just   be yourself!	you know what? you don't need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.
hi. i just had the worst anniversary ever.	i doubt that! tell her about us lastyear.
seriously?	word!
yeah, i really do! yes, but, after i dumped on the way he was gonna   propose to me, i don't think he's ever gonna ask again! i mean,   i said no in barbados and now this!	she's right! if i were a guy and...  did i just say if i were a  guy..?
! (phoebe stops herself from laughing) alright,   moving on...	oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!
oh, i don't know, i don't know, isn't that a little desperate?	oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!
yeah, that does make sense. ok, now, would... would you two  like that?	sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
yeah.	can we read it? can you print out another copy?
oh my god, oh my god, that letter is gonna go in our   file! we're never gonna get a kid. no, we're gonna be one of those old couples   that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!	it's ok, it's ok. you know what? i'll just   call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.
okay good.	 hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped   off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  uh-huh... uh-huh...   okay... thank you. good-bye. .
ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? you know what? just tell me on the way   to the bird store.	 they loved it.
what?	they thought it was very smart of us to have a  child write the recommendation letter.
 they thought joey was a child?	she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.	that sounds like fun.
well, if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would   it?	i think she looks cute. ... but i am wrong!
because there are so many terrible sights in this world.	like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was   in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
 o-okay!	hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
dead. oh, it's ok, no,  he  was old, yeah! and he lived a full life, he was in the first wave  at omaha beach.	hey, i'm sorry, i should have given you guys my   black book when i got married! although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. with janice's phone number on it.
 hi sweetie!	is monica not here?
no.	oh, then i'll tell you. my agency was bidding for  a big account and they got it! it's my first national commercial!
cool!	yeah, and i don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas   were mine! hell, you weren't there? all the ideas were  mine!! !
that's great! hey, can you cast me in it?	oh... i don't know, i really don't think you're   right for the part.
what do you mean? i can do anything, i'm a chameleon! huh? i'm old!	first of all. bravo. uh, but i really don't think   you're right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor.
i can do that! hello, i'm   your professor. when i'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. i like to use... oh, what's the product?	software that facilitates inter-business networking   e-solutions?
oh! any word on casting yet?	joe, i told you, you're just not right for   the part.
: look, c'mon, please? it's   not like i'm asking for some crazy favour. this is what i do for a living. i   am a professional actor! 	joe...
i'm sorry, this sounds like something i'm never gonna   be interested in.	joe...
just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't   pass it on to your bosses!	fine!
thank you.	work, joe!
damn it!	what am i gonna do now?
just pass it to your boss!	he's not right for the part. so if i suggest   him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's something they should   learn on their own!
just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked   it, but your bosses didn't. then that way, you're the good guy and   they're the bad guys.	that's good! i liked it, they didn't. joey, for god's sake,   go to work! .
what's up?	bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along   to my bosses and they weren't interested.
 oh.	 i'm sorry man.
 but, ehm... you watched   the tape?	 yeah! i... i... i liked it! but, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. stupid sons of bitches!
 you didn't watch the tape.	 what!? of course i did!
look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?	i'm not lying to you, i watched it!
well, you lied again!	i watched it!
keep going pinocchio!	  i did!
 no you didn't!	 i'm telling you, i watched the tape.
did you watch the tape?	  no!
but you are a liar.	what did i just say?
you still here?	yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am   insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...
ok whoah-hey... let me just stop you right there, ok? first, you lied, right? then, you lied about lying, ok? then you lied about   lying about lying, ok?	why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?
 and that's how i know you   didn't watch the tape! .	he really is a chameleon.
that's not the point chandler. the point is that you   lied.	i know. you're right. what's it gonna take for you   to forgive me?
now, what do you say?	lying is wrong!
and?... and?	i'm a pretty little girl.
oh, figuring out our wedding plans.	that's funny, we were doing the same thing!
it's really crazy! the hall, the dress, the food... i-i had no idea   how expensive this stuff was!	yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the   numbers.
so what did you two do about it?	it was pretty simple actually, i came up with a couple of cost-cutting   solutions, wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell.
i've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!	 maybe you do that next time you get married!
hey!	hey!
what's going on?	our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning   the apartment.
 we?	you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways!
hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?	kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
hey, maybe i should stop by! she could be a soap opera fan! it's very   impressive when the little people know a celebrity.	 little people?
ok, so i think i'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff   hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?	what...? no!
chandler?	 i don't, and i'm offended   by the insinuation!
ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes   taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the vcr?	i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not   mine.
ok.	here we go. stand up straight. big smile.
yay!	but you already gave all your money to charity!
well, i'll just ask for it back!	i don't think you can do that!
why not! this is her wedding day, this is way more important than some   stupid kids!	that's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.
ok. great. i am so glad that you are here. we're really excited   about getting this process started.	oh, because we love kids. love em to death.well, not actually   to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...   as allowed by law.
is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby   before   them. yeah! that guy tried to sell me drugs.	but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
oh...	what?
yes!	of course it was!
yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he   would call   me and he didn't.	rat bastard!
what was that?	oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he's great   with   kids though.
guys? everything ok? it's me, joe...	 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......aaaaaa-doption! !
what's going on?	oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls.
what's going on?	we'll talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine! !
is he alright out there by himself?	oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie.
bert and ernie!	 you can't make this stuff up!
 why don't i show you the baby's room?	what the hell are you doing?
well, you wouldn't let me in, so i thought you were in trouble.	well, we're not.
but you called me 'bert'!? that's our code word for danger!	we don't have a code word.
what room should we see next?	any room that isn't behind this couch!
so that was the baby's room.	any room that isn't behind this couch!
 i did not care for that!	 you have to get out of here. you slept   with   our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so   she can't   see you.
ok, ok!	ok!
oh my god!	and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and   we don't want to buy your bat!
bert! bert! bert! bert!	i can explain... joey...
are you friends with him?	i can explain... joey...
 i'm sorry that you had to see that. i'm so embarrassed...	oh, that's really ok.
hello...? oh hi... oh my god...! really...? i can't wait to tell chandler...   ok, goodbye.	wrong number?
it was laura... she gave us a great report and we are officially on   the waiting list.	that's great!
now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's   a baby waiting for us. oh...	hello...? have you seen joey's bat?
or win, lose or draw.	what did i marry into?
ross and i always wanted to be donny and marie.	you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
 ...and i'm a little bit rock 'n' roll!	 i'm leaving you.
so weird to see all these people again... oh my god, look, there's geoffrey cleric.	who?
he was roommates with john rosoff. he went out with andrea tamburino. she dumped him for michael skloff.	 did i go to this school?
hey, there's missy goldberg. you gotta remember her.	 sure, nice.
dude. you're married to my sister.	you're right, by saying nice i'm virtually licking her.
hey, i hear she's single again, d'you think i should ask her out?	are you asking permission to break the pact?
hey. hey, check out the flyers for the band. i made 'em on a macintosh in the computer room!	awesome, the name really stands out.
thanks to a little something called helvetica bold 24 point!	man, we're gonna rock that asian student union!
hey guys!	hey!
hey, missy...	you know, our band is playing on friday.
no way!	way!
right. i'll be there.	fresh!
boss!	mint!
she's gone.	i know it. you know, i'm totally gonna ask her out.
dude, i was gonna ask her out.	i said it first, bro.
well, i thought it first, holmes.	 look, if you did...
woha! wait... what are we doing? what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. i mean, we can get laid anytime we want.	totally. i had sex in high school...
me too. i'm good at it.	all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.
you got it.	all right, so that's missy goldberg, phoebe cates and molly ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
those are the pacts!	oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway.
thank you. all right, here i go. hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?	your hands are shaking.
you made out with missy goldberg. how could you do that, after you promised me?	 excuse me. . that didn't make us sound gay at all!
you broke the pact!	ross, that was 16 years ago!
that doesn't matter! we're talking about the foundation of our friendship.	i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. all right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
i didn't.	oh really?
no.	oh really! ?
no!	adrienne turner! !
yes?	hey! hey adrienne.
i never did anything with adrienne turner.	oh please, and you knew how much i liked her.
i don't know what... you're talking about.	really?
well lets see. maybe he knows where ross is. hey, how's it going .	aren't you...?
yeah, rachel. and this  is ross' sister, monica. we met at thanksgiving. .	 right. so how're you doing?
bitchin'	hi monica.
hi chandler. it's really nice to see you  not.	o-kay. i'll see if i can find ross.
i didn't know you knew about that.	well, i did and it hurt. that's when i wrote the song betrayal in the common room.
 man... i... i'm sorry.	look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
so, eh. i made out with adrienne and you made out with missy. well i guess we're even.	 hmm mmmhm..
we are even, right?	 just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody?
 what did you do to my mom?	not her!
that's weird. i've had the same number of beers as you and i don't feel anything at all.	soo... you girls having fun?
 i am soo not going to do good on my sats tomorrow.	well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
 oh yeah. there is a plan! why don't i just start taking my smart pills now?	well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
 oh, what a line.	so where are you applying to?
oh well, you know, i think it's kinda really important that i go somewhere where there's sun, so i'm sort of...   hey!	i'm in college and i'm in a band.
oh my god! that's wild!	yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
well, it matters to me.	why?
because... the night you kissed rachel was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time.	you kissed her that night too?
two guys in one night? wow, i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.	seriously, where did this happen?
okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, i went in there to make sure she was all right. she was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. well, i went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. but it was so dark, i accidentally got her lips.	oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?
mine.	i'm pretty sure i put her on my bed.
no, she was definitely on my bed.	why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
you were my first kiss ever?	what did i marry into?
hey!	you look great. i'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them.
okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?	no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding.
hey, i'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? but i'm just trying to be nice for the kids!	 you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.	heh.
oh, man!	this is like figure skating team all over again. i mean synchronized swimming. i mean- i mean the balance beam. help me!
football!	thank you.
i can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.	i know, i hate being left out of things.
hey guys, how is it going?	fine. we're just sitting here. alone. doing nothing.
yeah look, about tomorrow, i... i've got a question for ya. i just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.	what happened?
i'll do it!	 m-me-me-me!
you both wanna do it? uhm... there's only room for one.	pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus.
well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman.	oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!
you know, i really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. you know, phoebe knows you better, i'm gonna let her choose.	oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!
please, you're going down!	you are going downer!
is that what they say on the figure skating team?	 i wouldn't know, i didn't make it!
i decided to pee.	mike didn't tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out.
oh no, no. i can't choose between you two! i love you both so much!	just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
hi	hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
even so, i think i'm gonna pick ross.	let me tell you why you need to pick me. see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball.
all right fine, i pick you.	 y-y-yeeesss! make groom for chandler.
 good. i'm just getting some coffee. so i'm alert for the wedding.	 that's what i was doing too.
 well, you have fun tonight.	you too.
oh, i will.	me too.
wait a minute, i know why i'm being such an ass, why are you?	i'm not supposed to tell you.
i'm not supposed to tell you!	you told us both we could be in the wedding?
rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. you and me together again.	rach, rach, knock knock.
who's there?	i'll tell you at the wedding.
you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow. someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.	so technically, would this person be in the wedding?
 i crushed a pill and put it in her drink...  come on, sweetheart.	so technically, would this person be in the wedding?
i guess.	i'll do it!
no, but chandler, hello... aren't you scared of dogs?	i'm not scared. i'll just take little chappy and...  he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.
okay, if joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle.	 i'll do it.
ah ah...	 is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
okay. it's zero hour. all teams execute on my count. let's get this bad boy on the road.	 is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
 i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.	oh yeah!
groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid? we've got a broken arrow. bridesmaid down! oh, that's me.	ready?
 okay.	okay.
oh wait, oh no. wait.	wow! aren't you gonna be cold?
i don't care... i'll be my something blue.	you look beautiful.
it was, yeah. i kind of don't want it to end. hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?	i'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and i'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
nice. oh hey, what about ross?	i don't know. maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
oh!	so, where's mike?
hey.	why are you wearing my apron?
i'm making cookies for erica. and oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.	oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as my wife and the woman who's carrying my child? no? divorce?
well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to new york so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, statue of liberty, empire state building...	oh, those places! there's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes mooooo!
honey.	i'm so sorry...
everyone. erica, baby!	monica. calm, self.
welcome to new york city! or should i say ghe deu flooff new york city?	why would you say that?
oh yeah, let's do that!	great! this baby'd better to be really good.
oh, i'm glad. listen, i want to apologize about chandler, though. i just did not see this coming.	 new york is awesome!
what is with you?	yeah, i've been to these places before, but i've never really seen them, you know.
well, if there is anything else you wanna know...	oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
oh, sure. yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.	that's great.
well, there is a chance it's another guy. i mean, i have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.	so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too?
no... he killed his father with a shovel. but other than that, he's a great guy.	i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
are you awake?	of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake!
alright, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy.	honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer.
alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? no! would we treat him any differently?	i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is.
how?	i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.	pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. he probably loves him mommy. he's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel-wielding arm!
we had a good time. by the way, i wanted to ask you something. it would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, jiminy billy bob 	 oh, really?
no! you we're right, that was fun! i'm gonna go finish packing.	o-okay. so, is she gonna take the test?
nope, she doesn't have to, i found out who the father is.	oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it?
 no it's not.	how do you know?
well, it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.	oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
the thing we never do.	 shovely joe!
oh! yeah, this is fun, couples night.	yeah, i don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.	you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
oh, well, er, i already ate, but sure...! guess what happened at work today...	a dinosaur died a million years ago?
uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...	you never did it!
i'm sorry. it's just the idea of being an official bing.	hey! i will have you know that... aah, who am i kidding. let's call the kid geller and let bing die with me.
all right, let's see, call me mrs hannigan.	mrs hannigan?
 hey guys.	hey joe! we've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. you want to come with us?
all right. i know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.	yeah, come with us. you'll see how close it is to the city.
you know what? you are my friends, i wanna be supportive, i will come with you. shotgun!	damn it.
wrong again! apparently you can change it to anything you want. so i thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. so meet princess consuela banana hammock.	that's what we were gonna name the baby.
uhm, no. i'm gonna have my friends call me valerie.	hey, how'd the interview go?
oh! it's not good.	you know, i always feel that way after an interview. i'll bet it went better than you think.
well, i didn't get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren.	that is a bad interview.
oh, i thought joey was here. five is good. well, i'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.	ooh! israeli champagne. and it's vanilla!
...that center around work.	to ross!
thank you for letting us see the house again.	and thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... i've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
me too. yeah, this place is great. i'm so happy for you guys. although, you know, i hope you like fungus.	what?
 are you kiddin'? i think i just saw a bat in the corner!	when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
oh, i love this street. the trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.	man, those two dogs are going at it!
 hey!	hey.
oh, just er... you know, looking around. but you know what? this house... is great.	really? what changed your mind?
oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.	joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
 what?	ha! i'm just messing with you.
what? i get my own room?	you don't think we'd buy a house and not have a joey room do you?
oh my god! oh! hey, can i have an aquarium? and a sex swing?	no!
that guy mark. from bloomingdale's... she thinks he's just being nice to her. but i know he really wants to sleep with her.	it's seven years ago. my time machine works!
so what if he wants to sleep with her? i mean, she's single and he's cute.	excuse me?
oh please! yesterday on the subway? you couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.	for your information, i was staring at her baby. we're about to be parents.
should we send something?	how did the job stuff go?
he offered me one.	that's great!
previously on friends...	how did the job stuff go?
so if you take this job you'll be moving to paris?	or facing a bitch of a commute.
i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out...   anything we want.	my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
you okay with this?	well, it makes me feel sad, but...
talking to ross.	i see.
how is that gonna happen?	is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
hey phoebe. hey, tell me what you think. all right. the house next   door to the one that we're buying in westchester?	we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse   us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright.
but what if it is better than ours? should we at least look?	what do you think pheebs?
well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin   robbins... anyway... hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard?	yeah.
she died.	you're kidding!
yeah, last saturday. wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across   the atlantic. oh, wait a minute, i read the   wrong one.	oh yeah?
joey's gonna be *so* upset.	i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the   atlantic.
what if he reads it in the paper?	unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay.
thanks.	it feels like we're cheating on our house. and if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house,   that does stuff that our house won't do?
oh my god!	sure.
oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man   out of him, chandler used to be my little love muffin! . so?	 don't, don't!
no, actually, we're buying the house next door.	 why! ?
ooh, that decides it then. i was on the fence. but knowing that you two would be our neighbors? ah!	this can not be happening!
okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. maybe the janice's won't get it! maybe the other couple will.	the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple   are the hitlers.
 okay, okay,    all right. what if we got both houses? huh? we can turn this house   into a guest house.	that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful,   but when did you start crapping money! ?
okay, you come up with an idea.	alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on   our house. we can still get out.
but we love our house.	will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder   out here too. just the crickets and  oh my god!
okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever   we go! i mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. i mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls   jump back up inside your body.	 well, we   have to do something. we can't have her living next door. oh, that does it too.
all right, i got to run. tell monica i say goodbye. and... i'll see   you later, neighbor.	wait! i just want you to know that... i'm so happy you're going to   be here.
oh, me too...	because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
huh?	i never stopped loving you.
oh... my...	yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice   litman goralnik neihosenstein.
chandler, what are you talking about?	now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and   monica never have to know a thing.
i don't know what to say... i mean, you know, obviously we have this...   heat between us.	 obviously.
but i love my husband. and i know you love your wife. now, i don't   think we should get this house now.	don't say that. don't tangle the dream and take it away.
chandler, one of us has got to be strong.	i understand.
although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  goodbye chandler bing.	 they're never coming down now.
damnit!	hey!
hey!	so we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
oh my god! i have nothing left to teach you!	where's your passport?
it should be right next to my plane ticket.	well, it's not.
shoot. oh, i can't believe i did this!	at what point did it stop being funny that i took her passport?
are, are you kidding? this is packing?	we're taking a break!
from?	jumping on the bed?
you got it! . all right, she's right, we gotta get serious. let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!	no, no, no, guys. she's right. we should get to work. i'll take stuff out of the closet, joey you pack 'em and ross you re-pack whatever joey packs.
you guys hear a ringing?	 what the hell is this?
chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.	i didn't know monica had these!
mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. maybe richard!	why would she use them with richard and not me? i can be kinky! i once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
 hey.	hey.
oh, man! i can't believe she's actually leaving. how am i gonna say goodbye to rachel?	i know, she's been such a big part of my life. and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled. i mean... oh, forget it. i miss melrose place!
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? head she wins, tails i lose. wait a minute...	yes, joe?
chandler? i was just in our bedroom and i found these  on my pillow.	oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
what are you talking about? these aren't mine.	oh yeah, right! good luck getting another scarf dance from  me!
that would be a terrible punishment. but, i'm serious, i've never seen these before.	really? then what are they doing in our guestroom?
rachel used to live in that room.	rachel... with handcuffs! interesting!
joey's bare ass!	. well played.
 oh no, she took down monica... and i'm the crier in the family. oh god! i could be next. maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation.	uh, rach?
i really made you think about that thing uh?	 uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you.
 oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get.	no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room.
well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with...	don't say richard! well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
well, i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.	pheebs!
 yeah!	i think these are yours.
can i talk to you alone for a minute?	sure. you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
these are not mine... look how flimsy they are, come on! good god! you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.	sure. you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
oh honey...	let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving.
 oh, you know what? let's not say anything else. i love you.	ooh, not so tight...  i'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
oh!	i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't.
i don't think so.	oh, you're definately not. i haven't cried like that in years.
you cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.	that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
yeah. mine too.	mine was a humdinger
tell me about it.	well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
we're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. it would be great if you guys could pitch in.	joey and i can finish up in the guest room.
oh no! you and phoebe are gonna help me in here.	 you couldn't be cool.
good! now i need you to be careful and efficient. and remember, if i am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.	hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are.
you did? how?	well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used.
who's that dirty old lady?	monica's grandmother.
oh my god!	relax! we just get her some antacids.
she doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.	oh my god!
all right, chandler get the coats. erica let's go. phoebe and joey, keep packing! oh my god we're gonna have a baby.	honey, it's gonna be okay.
chandler, wait, wait, wait...	what?
oh my god!	relax! we'll just get her some antacids.
she doesn't have a stomach-ache. she's in labor!	oh my god!
breathe, breathe, breathe... good.	next time, can i say breathe?
alright, i'll be right back.	where are you going?
to use the bathroom.	you can't leave me alone with her.
what?	this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not   comfortable with!
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?	it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone   together.
you'll be fine. nah, you won't, but i'll be back in two   minutes.	okay.
i don't know. maybe church-camp?	hah. may not wanna mention this. so, you ever wonder which   is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
what?	well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will   ever know, because no one can experience both.
help me! this hurts!	is it really that bad?
oh! oh my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have   ever seen! chandler, you have to see this!	i'm okay.
chandler, you don't wanna miss this. this is the birth of your   child! it's the miracle of life!	alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
it's a... it's a boy!	wow!
oh, you did it!	 it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some  other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.
would you like to cut the umbilical cord?	well, that's spongy.
oh, we are so lucky!	i know. he has your eyes.
we'll just get him cleaned up a bit.	okay.
i'm really happy for you guys.	how do you feel?
you know it's twins, right?	oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know!
i can't believe you didn't know it's twins! this has never   happened before.	well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good.
twins actually run in my family.	interesting! can i see you for a second?
what do you mean what do we do?	 twins! twins! !
chandler, you're panicking!	uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
we can't split them up!	why not? we could give each of them half a medallion, and   then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. i mean,   that's a great day for everybody.
okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?	what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?
yeah, because i hear the king is looking to adopt.	monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
that doesn't matter! we have waited so long for this. i don't   care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies!	 okay. shhh...
okay!	okay!
here she comes!	 she? it's a girl?
yeah.	 well, now we have one of each! and that's enough!
do you think they recognize each other from in there?	maybe. unless they're like two people who have lived in   apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're   pushed through a vagina and they meet.
bye!	bye!
okay.	have fun at church-camp!
oh, look at these little bunnies!	i know! you ready to trade?
okay.	okay.
alright, let's see..	we could trade later.
hi! oh my gosh!	hey.
 this is a boy,  and that's a girl.	her name is erica.
hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.	yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time  together.
i love you.	i love you.
this is so cool!	i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!
quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...	we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but  now we understand you were doing this.
okay, i wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,  i got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!	really? you got us a chick and a duck?
yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now  they're gone!	oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
actually, i'm gonna go check on the twins.	alright.
oh!	it's okay, it's just an egg roll.
just put it on a plate and leave.	okay, let's find these birds.
oh! they're in the table!	well, that can't be good!
we gotta get them out of there!	how?
oh, oh! maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?	oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman.
well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.	joey, wait! the ball!
oh god! so what do we do?	i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow.
okay.	no... it's all glued together.
does that mean we have to bust it open?	i don't know. maybe.
oh my god!	i know! it's.. it's the foosball table.
all right, you know what? we don't have a choice. it's like i would   have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part. those are our   men in there, we have to get them out!	did that movie ever get made?
 don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of   there.	and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
okay. here goes.	what's the matter?
i need to say goodbye to the table first.	i understand.
okay. table, you have given us so many great times. and you   guys, jordan, victor, joel... all of you guys. what can i say?	i don't know. except that, for one last time...  good game, good game, good game,   good game, good game, good game, good game.
okay, here we go. i can't do it.	well, i can't do it either.
yeah, they're stuck inside the table!	we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
alright. my job here is done.	that was... impressive.
yeah, they were just slowing me down. alright, i have to get   back to the babies. i'll see you girls later.	sorry about the table, man.
yeah.	you gonna buy a new one?
probably not. nah. i don't know how much i'm gonna wanna play   after you go.	well, at least we got these little guys out.
yeah.	aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get   used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
i'm gonna miss these little guys. it was nice having birds   around again.	hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.
what?	yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus,   here they'd have their own room.
i could get a goose!	you know, i - i think you're set with the poultry.
thanks man. did you hear that, you guys? you're gonna get to   stay here! and, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a   reason to come visit.	i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame   cool guy handshake?
well, that's it. everything's packed.	wow, this is weird.
yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.	where's ross?
has it always been purple?	 look around, you guys. this was your first   home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but   more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our   keys.	oh, okay.
 this is harder than i thought it would be.	oh, it's gonna be okay.
okay, should we get some coffee?	sure. where?
